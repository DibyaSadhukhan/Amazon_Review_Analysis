Very slow to boot up and also slow while loading applications, frequent firmware updates(every two days) and have done at least 3 times since I bought it in a space of one week.||The laptop shows a blank dark screen after reboot and then i need to shut down and restart again multiple times.||The product will only be replaced & no returns accepted and every time after replacement the customer should pay installation charges which costs around 800 bucks.||It's getting stuck ..taking more times for open and speed is not good ... Pls üôè don't purchase this laptop ..bad experience this lappi
