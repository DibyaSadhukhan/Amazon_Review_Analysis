price|:|For this price, value of the product is high.Do not know about gaming capabilities yet.Pros:1) Instant Boot up.2) Instant shut down.3) Touch screen.4) Light weight (1.49 Kgs).5) MS office (For Android) from play store can be used.6) As an easy free alternative - Since Google have almost all applications, suh as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides etc.||There are better options  for the same price.||It's not for hardcore work (coding/video editing, number crunching using ms office / high end windows softwares)Pros- Compact form factor.- Decent Built Quality, it's plastic but does not feel cheap.- Awesome battery life (10-13 hrs), mostly performs better than my phone and windows laptop.- Fast Charging (45 mins, 0 to100%), 45W Charger which is USB type C, and not like the usual bulky laptop chargers.- Specs are decent enough to support the OS, Apps and all rest of the functionality, the laptop is quick to load and takes almost everything u throw at it without really stuttering.- I think it's far better than a tab with the option of working as a full laptop and convertible to a tab which can do landscape/portrait modes like a charm.- Awesome backlit keyboard, feels way better than most of the windows ones in this price, also they keyboard gets disabled when rotated so no issues on keys getting pressed while in tab mode.- Liked the color options on this - it's matt finish and looks more expensive than it's price !Cons- Was very disappointed with the display, it's below average (extremely bad viewing angles, it's not an FHD screen).||I do not think the display is justified at this price range (31K).||This for me was the biggest con - and  honestly i am even thinking of returning it just for this one issue, we need to keep changing the angles in sunlight while in tab mode to read a news paper/article.- May be i have not figured this one yet, but when in tab mode if it goes idle - it does not come back on unless bought into laptop mode.- Speakers are below average, they are loud - but not clear (again thy could do better at this price)
Pros :1.||Its good for students who do only classes...its just a big browser..like a big tab...but in this price its a good buy...again strictly would work excellent for students for online classes..
Amazing laptopBattery life once fully charged worked for the whole day.Touch is also good.Speakers are very good volume is loud and clear.Camera is ok ok.Keyboard is awesomeOver all best option in this range if you want both laptop and tablet.||Loved the product, first time user of chrome book, must confess, looks impressive, at this price 27k) it's a steal!|_|storage|:|we won't feel any limitations when compared to a normal laptop.7) Classic look.8) Have 4 layers of security.Cons:1) Disk storage 64 GB only.||But cloud can be used for storage for further.||How do I claim the free 100GB google drive storage.||Without thinking go for it
Good for those who wrok mostly on internet, storage is an issue, 100gb cloud storage is bluff, but great for study purpose watching movies and all( you will have to adjust your screen for best viewing angle)
No slot for micro SD , though company claim of 256 gb micro SD card expandable.|_|screen|:|I'm personally biased towards AMD processors and this time as well AMD did not disappoint.Performance in the converted tablet mode is also good, albeit the 16:9 ratio on a 14 inch screen does require some getting used to.||For this price, value of the product is high.Do not know about gaming capabilities yet.Pros:1) Instant Boot up.2) Instant shut down.3) Touch screen.4) Light weight (1.49 Kgs).5) MS office (For Android) from play store can be used.6) As an easy free alternative - Since Google have almost all applications, suh as Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides etc.||Screen quality is just okay.If you're here looking for a chromebook (that means you accept that it is limited to certain features and completely depends on network) then you can consider buying this.I would suggest buying a screen protector along with it.Edited: I suggest looking for other Chromebooks and keep this as a last resort.||It's not for hardcore work (coding/video editing, number crunching using ms office / high end windows softwares)Pros- Compact form factor.- Decent Built Quality, it's plastic but does not feel cheap.- Awesome battery life (10-13 hrs), mostly performs better than my phone and windows laptop.- Fast Charging (45 mins, 0 to100%), 45W Charger which is USB type C, and not like the usual bulky laptop chargers.- Specs are decent enough to support the OS, Apps and all rest of the functionality, the laptop is quick to load and takes almost everything u throw at it without really stuttering.- I think it's far better than a tab with the option of working as a full laptop and convertible to a tab which can do landscape/portrait modes like a charm.- Awesome backlit keyboard, feels way better than most of the windows ones in this price, also they keyboard gets disabled when rotated so no issues on keys getting pressed while in tab mode.- Liked the color options on this - it's matt finish and looks more expensive than it's price !Cons- Was very disappointed with the display, it's below average (extremely bad viewing angles, it's not an FHD screen).||Without thinking go for it
