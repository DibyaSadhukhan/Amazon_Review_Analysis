Low camera clarity
I got it at best price, restart and updates taking time.Overall good.||Within three weeks the camera of the laptop has stopped working.|_|quality|:|if it is 8 GB ram deffnetly performance will improve amd 3020e chipset  really a power saving chip and there is no heating issue at all.laptop charging speed is amazing, sound is average ,earphone sound quality is good ,Dolby sound equaliser does the job better,,only becoz of this cheap disply no one is going to accept this laptoplaptop,Lenovo could have given IPS HD disply otherwise budget friendly normal usage laptop from lenove
I was happy by this product.||Read this review before u purchase this laptop..i will clarify all your queriesU can blindly buy this laptop if the price is below 25.6kFor this price range performance is okay..u may find Avita laptop provide more specs from this..go for Avita ..if u no need of separate nmbr pad and u are okay with windows SWe wont sit on this laptop , we will not keep this laptop under JCB tier ..so build quality is enough for a normal personIf u are looking for laptop under 30k then u buy this product and replace SSD as a primary storage , it will cost around 2.5k or less..now under 30k this will be the best laptopU won't get free Microsoft office inluded in this laptopBattery is good from asus and avitaDisplay is okay..Camera is worst ..don't buy this laptop if camara is ur priority, for online class, Skype call.||üòÉüòÉüòÉBut camera quality is a bit low
