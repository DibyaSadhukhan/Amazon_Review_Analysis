With in a month it's working stoped", 'The media could not be loaded.||The media could not be loaded.||The media could not be loaded.|_|customer|:|I'm a Technology Enthusiast and also a business owner, I'm already using One MacBook Pro but im in need of one more laptop because of increase work load.I Come across RDP brand thru Google, when i searched laptop under 25000, i heard RDP name for the first time, so i did a little research about the company and come across that it is an indian company based out of RDP, who design and manufacture IT Hardware - nice website and nice company profile.I was worried about their post sales service before the purchase being a new brand, so i just did a ghost call to their company number for a service request, then they promptly created support ticket asking for the device serial number that i could not give because i dont have one, so i said ill share later today and ended the call, to my surprise im getting reminder mails from them to share the serial number of the device to take my support request formward, out of my curiosity i called them again and said thanks for reminder mails and asked about their support system, then the person said we have strict SLA to every customer ticket so we do lot of followup with customers and asked me to download their SLA table from their website home page, i downloaded the SLA table and blown my mind that they have such a hard commitment towards post sales support.so with out further ado i just went ahead and purchased, great amazon delivery i got it before the promised time...The device packing is awesome, the device built is excellent, as it came with Windows 10 Pro Original with Windows sticker and Intel sticker on it assured me the quality standard..last 24 hours im using it, i strongly feel it is worth more than what i have paid, it has quad core processor, 4gb ram, i got 7+ hour battery backup, screen is superb, it has 64gb storage but it has microsd slot and HDD slot (so i can fix HDD/SDD any time if i require more space) now a days all my applications are cloud, so immediately i no need to think of additional storage.i give 5-star rating and strongly suggest to buy this product, if your usage applications are Internet Browsing (10-15 browsing tabs simulatenously), online meetings/classes, MS Office, youtube/netflix sound is very good inside the room, but not loud in public places, i started using zoho business applications and tally, it is super smooth because of quad-core processor and 4gb ram - i dont recommed this device if you want to use photoshop/3D studio or video editing or play high end games.it has suffient i/o ports as well (USB3, USB2 and even TypeC also), almost to the thickness of my macbook pro, very less weight too (they mentioned it as around 1.4kg)
@\u2068Rajesh Uk\u2069i have purchased this device for my kids online education, this laptop is perfectly working for online classes, the device is very thin and light weight, 6 hours of battery backup is really superb, original windows 10 pro operating system, very nice packing, i have bought this on my neighbour recommendation, he said after sales support is also very good from RDP, amazon delivery also very good..||On complaining to customer care, they told to use the laptop and if any problem occurs can be returned.||The mouse touchpad doesn't work properly, but the customer care could not be reached.||Keyoardecamedisfunctional,thiscommentisproofthatspacekeyisnotworking.attched1tinternaldriefailed.Had to buy external keyboard because many keys are not functional in RDP Notebook 2 .Above comment was written ,using  Notebook 2 keyboard .This comment is by bought and added external keyboard bought and attached by me..Horrible experience of online shopping of my life This is not even a month complete.Strongly warn buyers not to buy this horrible product and face the horror , like me .Only God can save customers .Slowly day by day new problemas are appearing .I am unfortunate that RETURN option period is OVER .||Tried to contact the customer executive, they say they'll arrange a pick-up for the repair but no response after that.||I don\'t recommend buying RDP laptop to anyone, although the laptop functioned ok to expectation initially, its not powering on within 3months of purchase , regularly over a week now we are emailing and calling customer support, ..on mail they created ticket after which customer service said "will call us back today" on every single call we made for past 1 week , most of the times call is not getting attended.||"Do not buy this product"
Most worst product, my being an Amazon customer since 8 years, due to this, fradulence activity of fake product by amazon I will drag them to Consumer forum, remain assured
after laptop delivery, i had few doubts, i called their customer care, their response is prompt and very professional, my first impression on the laptop is very good, performance is more than what i expected, im planning to buy one more device and i also suggested 2 of my friends to buy because of amazon offer

Keyboard keys not working properly.||\xa0No issues ... battery üîã ok  6hr ...display 1080p....No lag....No hitting issue
Good for WFH, projects, online classes purposes etc  worth for money, good customer care  support, any issues they will assist us and contact them through their Website.||Reached the customer care and they just have a bot which acknowledge the request and then respond with a message that the product detail doesn't match.||Their customer support is terrible.||I called for customer care 5 times; no responseGuys... Plz buy a laptop from a genuine company.||But the customer support team worked excellent and came to my rescue.||I am grateful to the customer support team consisting Mr.Srikant, Mr.Fayaz and others.||Best customer support team ever I expected.||\xa0Laptop is worst product....waste of money....Supplier send the product seal open package...and also battery missing.....then replacement came and found seal open....but accepted by me....then in second day...laptop not getting boot ....customer service not working....spare parts not available...its under warranty period...who will attend it not known...||It has been slightly over a month and the laptop has been problematic.The windows keep on booting with no help from customer service so far.Called up the RDP support  multiple times but they disconnected the call
Good one to buy, but you want to add SSD.||Not upto the mark like Thinbook 1, performance is lower than even Thinbook 1
This product is damaged and Amazon do not help you any type and rdp customer care number not connect so don't buy itAnd if Amazon not help me then I will complain to consumer court

Bad
Disliked the quality, no service center, facing problem after 8-10 days of purchase, no customer service support.||The customer care service for this company is very poor.||RDP customer care not giving any response.||But it doesn't have an inbuilt HDD which needs to be bought separately by customer.||\xa0Not open the screen properly
Worst product don't buy , it is not working,  customer service no is not working and no responses.||I called up customer service told them my model number (this is important to note) and explained the issue .. they asked me to ship it to Andra .. Ananthapur ..||Within 2 weeks of purchase, it started going on to boot loop.When I raised issue with RDP, they arranged pickup for thier laptop to fix all the issue.It has been 40 days, they have not returned it back.Even they pathetic customer service, with no regards to suffering of other.They are making money by fooling common people.|_|
