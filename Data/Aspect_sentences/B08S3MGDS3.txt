time|:|From the time I opened the machine I felt let down by HP.1.||Though it had better performing Processor and 8 GB RAM, every app takes time to load, horrible lag right from the first time I started the system.||Everytime I check two of the 3 parameters (Disk, Memory, CPU) will be hovering around 85-100.||Please don't buy this product,Specs are great but it dam dam slow.Its running slower then pentium processor.Sometimes it crashes.||Really it takes long time to open any application.||And most hurtful part is amazon team only do replacement not able to buy different brand laptop.Based on the reviews and my personal experience abt this product is, its completely failure model.Dear Buyers pls dont wasting time here to buy this laptop and one or other way you will  apply replacementBetter amazon has to stop worst quality products based on customer reviews.Now i have to wait for my replacement and if the replacement product also not good !||Booting time is so bad it literally takes 5 to 6 minutes to open up.||My 5 year old laptop is much faster than this laptop, It is having very poor speed, time lags.||In terms of battery backup it is worst than acer asus performance
First thing is boot time- very slow even with i3 processor.Just in 15 days of usage I got a 3fo error which the customer care has not able to fix since a month.Hp does not have a escalation matrix, no mail support, only whatâ€™s app support.I raised a ticket for on site service which has been more than 10 days now , no sort of contact from any hp employees.I have wasted my time energy and I am frustrated to get help from the customer support.||It takes too long time to load chrome.It says M.2 slot is available but it's not nvme, it's PCIe, it means you will get slower speed than nvme.Keyboard letters are visible only if you are watching it from top, if u try to see from sides it's not visible.||Several time Hang & battery problemBattery BackupOnly 3 hours
I purchased this laptop believing its new however when I checked for warranty and contacted HP , I came to know that laptop is running under the extended warranty and that too only 9 months are remaining.||System is nice , booting Speed also good take little more time compare to ssd that's why I feel it's little expensive, build quality , sound, display, etc all are good.alexa is in build but it's not much usefull.Keypad haven't backlight.||Takes time to bootBest for Stay at home moms, writers, online classes, its a school student laptop, good for teachers too

Please don't buy home premium laptop", 'At the start of computer purchasing desktop was very fast, but as days go by about 3 or 4 days it is taking more time and also google chrome wasn"t working well and on a short timer intervals it goes black and comes back again, in my view home premium is totally worthless and waste.||Okay in this price rangeI'm just using office purpose, no issue with heavy outlook data and usage since 15 days.Audio is good.It takes long time to bootDelicate keys.Okay with webcam on day light.Plastic body.||Good
