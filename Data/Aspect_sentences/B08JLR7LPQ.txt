battery|:|Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing.||Temps stayed below 90 at full load.6) Linux compatibility:Works, I'm running Manjaro but out of the box touchpad isn't working and display brightness can't be lowered(fixes available for both).Great laptop overall, only issue for me is average battery life, I expected more since this has a 60whr battery and a 7nm processor but you can run this for 5+ hours doing light stuff at medium brightness and keyboard lighting off.||I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast.||You cant even hear its fans churning in the summer when your ceiling fan makes more noise than your laptop cracking games at performance mode üòùBattery: Reviews here are so negetive about battery but I found it to last around 6-7 hours when doing casual work.||Well still, Id say battery performance is sufficient.||But the battery charges fast enough as it is.Build quality: Legion is legion.||Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more.||Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery.||The laptop performs good, good wifi,good gpu,fast ram but it has a major compromise on display, battery and camera.||The colours on the display are not that good and the battery is decent.||Must buy if u don't care bout battery üîã.Edit- after updates battery is good and the camera is improved.||Overall I'll rate it 4.5/5, as it lacks RGB keyboard and battery and colour accuracy.||I am the kinda guy that does not care about the battery life OR the weight of the device, not at least when you know you bought a gaming laptop.||Still, it weighs around 2KG and the battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs with normal usage, which, I must say is more than enough.I would say the display could have been better with the color accuracy but this thing with a 120Hz refresh rate does a farely good job averall.||Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.||But apart from that it's a perfect device and I would suggest to go for it
The screen is more on a warmer side ,Battery is averaged for office usage or entertainment purpose (lasts around 2.5 hours at 3brightnessIt has 0-7 level for brightness and 0-1 is useless with close to 0 visibility due to warm shades produced on screenRGB production is valued at 33.8%For gaming battery lasts around 50 minutesVery good drivers for sound production and can be used for midi controls over productionSound card badLaptop turns into thermal mode often during games setting at ultra or highCS:GO would easily turn the fans on making it cause more power
I JUST LOVED IT.Don't compare it with any laptop under 75k, it really has destroyed the competition.HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS THAT I FOUND AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE ...PROS1.||However,The battery is the biggest disappointment.||Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works.||When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass.||Upon inspection it had a layer of laminate.Okay the first impressions were:1) Laptop is blazing fast man (With the pairing of Ryzen 5 and GTX 1650) it's a feast to your eye coming from 60hz.2) Camera was really bad (considering every gaming laptop camera)3) Battery is really bad (You have to limit your usage pretty much to no internet for getting a good percentage of battery left).||I used YouTube for like an hour and the battery depleted way soon.||According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup.||I just bought the product online on june 1 but the warranty says its already activated on April 2021 and am getting around 11months of warranty instead of a year of series
Good boot uo speeds and smooth overall usage in terms of response,loading times for softwares and gaming.I can't say much about the battery, I use it plugged in 90% of the time, with conservative battery which keeps it from going above 60% charge, so you can say the battery is just like any other gaming laptop out there.The screen isn't as bright as I'd like for certain situations.It's not something that's a serious problem, you can manage with the brightness it provides, but making it a brighter screen would've made it even better than it already is.Overall the build is very good, feels sturdy.I'd say it's a good option consider for the 60 to 70k range of laptops.||But I faced issue with battery as it is getting discharge very fast so I asked for replacement Now it is working fine.||Everything is basically gliding in it
Received in excellent packagingAs far as purchase is concerned not a single time I have regretted this purchase for this price, laptop looks much better in reality than compare to image shown here,it does not look like gaming machine(this was my primary reason to buy it) it's fast, no lags,Amd ryzen 5 does handle all task with so much ease, it boots up in less than 5 seconds, does not heat up even after prolong use,keyboard is excellentOnly area where it could have been better was 1)battery expect around 2.5 to 3hours of backup battery2)camera it could have been better
It is a very very good and great laptop that I have bought from Amazon.||If it would have been a rgb backlit keyboard then it would have been better(9) Battery - Surprisingly its good as I was getting a usage of 5-6hrs with 50% brightness, hybrid mode and battery saver turned on
‚Ä¢First of all the battery discharges so quickly like within 1 2 hours of watching videos or surfing and when it comes to gaming battery discharges to 20 percent in 30 minutes when it's 100 percent changed.‚Ä¢There is a minor issue with the keyboard or it is just me, the thing is there is so low key travel like i don't even feel like I'm pressing a key or not again this can differ person to person.‚Ä¢The last thing and the most important one is the display it went blank 2 times when i restarted the pc like for one and half hour it was blank i was literally shaking and nervous like what should i do now but after watching some video and researching about it i found out it automatically recovers from that by closing it and waiting for 15 20 minutes, this is an extremely dangerous fault which needs to be fixed asap.I will give this laptop 6 out of 10.||Supports smart charge, good for battery life when plugged in 24x7.Screen if really good.||Problem started from day one and there is no support either from Amazon and issues with hardware and software both , May he vendor is trying to sale all his refurbished laptops
Lenovo legion is a good laptop for gaming and office use, updated with latest BIOS and other updates from lenovo software, build quality is very good, display is good, over all happy to get this legion after trying for many days, still testing the battery performance will update after few days of use.||I usually get a battery backup of around 4hrs during my online work.||It exceded my expectations  in terms of performance and build qualityit gives abt 150 fps in valorant all high settigns120 on high settings in fortnitetalking abt battery life its great around 5 hours of normal use(like youtube ,web browsing etc)track pad works greatdisplay is also nice 120 hz i coud'nt see any ghosting issuesThe fans are also not that loud
I am using this laptop for almost 4 months now i am very happy with my purchase.||There is only one con till date which i find in this laptop ie battery life, being a gaming laptop its battery life sucks.||Otherwise its gives maximum 1.5 to 2 hours of battery life.||You can enable hybrid mode in vantage setting to icrease battery life to 6-7 hrs.||\xa0Product arrived in good condition , packaging was up to the mark , overall performance is good, however webcam could have been better , average battery life 4 hours at most which is understandable being a gaming laptop .||I love the laptop build quality...It is really good among this segment..The battery life is average but it can be increased upto 6 to 8 hr if you put the laptop on silent mode as well as hybrid mode which restrict the dedicated gpu usage..so you can disable it just by enable hybrid mode in lenovo vintage app..The keyboard is really good.||!Great thermals.. high refresh rate... Good battery !!||Only 2 things that could hv been better are- battery life for normal usage is not enough(2-3 hrs) and camera quality could hv been better like its competitors in same price range.||my amd radeon software app doesn't work and ssd recieve data sk hynix all person said sdd brand samsund but show sk hynix why
Working amazingly for gaming...battery life under normal conditions goes for 5 hours or so and while playing game like dota2 it reduces to 3 hours...however always plug in while gaming so this doesn't really matter
Its perfect for gaming and handles thermals well.||Camera quality and battery is on the downside but it is manageable.My only concern is that the intake vents are comparatively big which supports thermals but also intake dust.||Really good battery life for a gaming laptop.||Useless product as per battery is concern.Lenovo claims battery back up for mor than  6 hours.But it lasts hardly for 2.30 hours even when on quite mode,50% brightness  and document work only .||and microphone muted and not working pls careful to amazon as it is not right
The laptop is good, the product was delivered well, satisfied with the experience
Has 5 hour battery life which is the highest in gaming laptops of this range plus really sturdy built quality , best cooling system and a beast of a gaming laptop in this range
Good for gaming.||But u may get disappointed in battery life.But charger comes with 170w speed charger
Got this for 55K after an exchange of i5-2nd gen. For that price this is awesome.Used it for 3 Months now and I have zero complaints.||\xa0Very good legion 5 for gamingRyzen 5 4600H and Nvidia 1650 extremely good.....
Amazing laptopGot 150-175 fps in valorantNo heating issues you should definitely go for itFirst I was also doubtful about the product but when I received the laptop it was amazing .If the product come in deal of the day buy it immediately
Battery life is poor, hardly useable for 3.5 hrs.Display is super smooth .And overall it's a value for money laptop..üëç
Everything is good, except for battery life.||Screen brightness is low at 250 nits max.Need to plug in every now and then because it has only 60 watt hour battery.||Thank you
Mainly good for gaming,little over priced and the battery is Ok , you have to play game when plugged in socket.||During light task battery back up upto 2 and half hours
It has really some cool lenovo features.Battery life for a normal use is around 4-5hrs.Booting time is really amazing(less than 10sec).||has very good battery charge very fast and lasts very long not done enough gaming only played minecraft which ran very smooth got it today itself
The media could not be loaded.||bilkul shi h for gaming , camera , battery working perfectlybatery on movie 6 to u hours running fast while gaming and camera is also good
Overall good package under 70k.||Top level performance .Avg battery life.||Avg speaker quality
BATTERY LIFE IS NOT LIKE THAT WHAT IS DISCRIBES IN DESCRIPTIONSOME TIMES HANGS EVEN IT HAVE 8 GB RAM IN NORMAL USAGE
Worst battery backup...||If looking for long battery life... .||There is no flow whatsoever in using this laptop, comparatively better battery life, good screen refresh rate and incredible performance
It works awesome at this price range, personally I like ryzen than intel, Nice!!!!!!||Average battery life an nice camera
Product good as per the specs
Good laptop .....Decent .....nails the basics .....offers pretty much everything other laptops offer in this price range

i thik battery cosume very early
Good product no RGB that's all
Wonderful Experience.||Interesting is you can upgrade battery to 80watts .||It improves to some extent battery life definitely the write and read speeds.3.||Keeping 250 nits give you better battery life with 60watt battery.4.||Even HP omen this price model has less watt battery.Even ThinkPad E series is 54wh battery.5.||60 Wh battery slightly more than others, 170 watt power brick highest in the range i think.7.||Battery life is average considering its a gamming laptop i got 3 hr+ battery.||I get this laptop in 62k in Amazon sale ,I will recommend this laptop over HP pavilion & asus tuf 15 because main advantage of this laptop over other is its thermal system its best thermal system i ever seen in such that price you will go with hap pavilion both are same but hp pavilion 4600 r5 is expensive than legion 5 but both laptop are good ignore asus tuf its thermal system is not as other two laptopPros- display is far superior than others laptop(120hz) in same price range and i already told you about thermals , keyboard is nice , build quality is good, it has its unique design as you see in pictures, speaker are pretty loud & battery backup is good i means its really good it includes 170w charger laptop have 4 usb 3 ports means you don't need extra hub , boot time is same as all r5 4600 laptopCons- weight 2.3 kg i know 2.3 is not heavy but once if you buy laptop then you will realize why i am saying this its heavy , design many of like that kind of design but some not if u don't like this design or you want leaa heavy laptop or you don't want Chinese product then go for hp pavillion 15 it is also good but little bit expensive
Most indemanding laptop in india for absolute reason.Pros:1.||üò∞ very disappointing
No brand is giving you 60Wh battery in 65k, what are you waiting for just go for it, you won't regret it

Doesn't meet the expectations better to go for dell g series and Intel processor and is becoming sluggish.. better to go i7 or atleast i5
Gaming could be done at high settings with minor glitchoverall a good project as compared to other i5 machines.THE ONLY ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFEI KID YOU NOT BRUV!This has pathetic backup.||This has no battery whatsoever.||Have to always keep plugged in.Buy if you are okay with a laptop with no battery!||I'm using it for a week,Pros-1.Ryzen 5 4600H with GTX1650 gives a good perfomance2.battery backup is good3.has 4 USB ports of 3rd generation4.no overheating issuesCons-1.keyboard could be RGB  Overall experience- best pick if your budget is 68k

(1) Build quality- It really feels premium in hands .The screen flex  is negligible and it doesn't wobble too(2) Display- It's crisp and clear.||Also it has a high refresh rate of 120hz which makes your gaming experience much more smoother and fasterIf it would have been a 300 nits panel then it would have been better.Although this 250 nits panel is also good but can't be used in harsh sunlight(3) Performance- The ryzen 5 4600h easily beats i7 9th gen and almost equivalent to i7 10th gen.||The fans are too quiet and it doesn't heat at all even long hours of gaming or working(5) Speaker- They are so damn good and also has a bass effect.||If it would have been a rgb backlit keyboard then it would have been better(9) Battery - Surprisingly its good as I was getting a usage of 5-6hrs with 50% brightness, hybrid mode and battery saver turned on
‚Ä¢First of all the battery discharges so quickly like within 1 2 hours of watching videos or surfing and when it comes to gaming battery discharges to 20 percent in 30 minutes when it's 100 percent changed.‚Ä¢There is a minor issue with the keyboard or it is just me, the thing is there is so low key travel like i don't even feel like I'm pressing a key or not again this can differ person to person.‚Ä¢The last thing and the most important one is the display it went blank 2 times when i restarted the pc like for one and half hour it was blank i was literally shaking and nervous like what should i do now but after watching some video and researching about it i found out it automatically recovers from that by closing it and waiting for 15 20 minutes, this is an extremely dangerous fault which needs to be fixed asap.I will give this laptop 6 out of 10.||He seems to be gaming too without any probs.||Problem started from day one and there is no support either from Amazon and issues with hardware and software both , May he vendor is trying to sale all his refurbished laptops
Lenovo legion is a good laptop for gaming and office use, updated with latest BIOS and other updates from lenovo software, build quality is very good, display is good, over all happy to get this legion after trying for many days, still testing the battery performance will update after few days of use.||The laptop has great thermals, I didn't feel any kind of heat on my fingers while gaming for around 4-5 hrs.||The camera is normal.Finally this is an ultimate machine for gaming and work.||Ideal for kids virtual schooling and gaming, as of now both the laptops seem to be working well for all games including fortnight.||There is only one con till date which i find in this laptop ie battery life, being a gaming laptop its battery life sucks.||\xa0The laptop is great!It's great for casual gaming.Design is awesome.Screen is good and sufficiently bright.||This is for those who need gaming laptop but not very font of that "gaming look", its just value for money i completely recommend this this boot time is nearly 5-6 second and is smooth.||Don't Think much just buy it:)
Go for it.Cooling system is best.Throttling is also good.Using from last 2 months with extreme load and heavy gaming and still working smooth without any issue.Battery life is 3-4 hrs without gaming basic use.||\xa0Product arrived in good condition , packaging was up to the mark , overall performance is good, however webcam could have been better , average battery life 4 hours at most which is understandable being a gaming laptop .||No Lags , CS Go gaming 150fps average in high settings.Sturdy and High Build Quality , many Ports,.||Decent mid range gaming laptop for sure.||I recommend this oneüòÄ
Fulfills the purpose of gaming very nicely.||But then again if you are buying for gaming experience this one does the job pretty well.||my amd radeon software app doesn't work and ssd recieve data sk hynix all person said sdd brand samsund but show sk hynix why
Working amazingly for gaming...battery life under normal conditions goes for 5 hours or so and while playing game like dota2 it reduces to 3 hours...however always plug in while gaming so this doesn't really matter
Its perfect for gaming and handles thermals well.||Screen goes maximum only 250 nits which is below average and there is screen bleeding which makes laptop hard to use in dark environment.Overall laptop and build quality is good but it is heavier than expected.The best thing is that thermal, no matter how much game you play it is never noticable
A perfect laptop for productivity and casual gaming don't think too much thermals are super fan noise is low
Rock-solid build quality for a laptop with a professional look.||Really good battery life for a gaming laptop.||Can run gaming applications on high settings very easily.||and microphone muted and not working pls careful to amazon as it is not right
The laptop is good, the product was delivered well, satisfied with the experience

Everything is good i would rather suggest tou to go for 512 ssd version
It is currently the best gaming laptop under 70k, Total value for money
Camera is not as expected.Others all features are outstanding.||Yes it cam be recommended for the casual gaming.||Speaker are good too for a gaming laptop sound is clear not that loud.5.||~65% sRGB Colors dont look that punchy but gaming remains unaffected5.||üò∞ very disappointing
No brand is giving you 60Wh battery in 65k, what are you waiting for just go for it, you won't regret it
This laptop is awesome I baught it in 67 in offline storeGive high fps in almost all games  üòç must buy if your budget is 70k batter then asus rog and tuf with same specsThe thermal is good never go above 65¬∞c.Over all best gaming laptop in this price üõê
Doesn't meet the expectations better to go for dell g series and Intel processor and is becoming sluggish.. better to go i7 or atleast i5
Gaming could be done at high settings with minor glitchoverall a good project as compared to other i5 machines.THE ONLY ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFEI KID YOU NOT BRUV!This has pathetic backup.||I'm using it for a week,Pros-1.Ryzen 5 4600H with GTX1650 gives a good perfomance2.battery backup is good3.has 4 USB ports of 3rd generation4.no overheating issuesCons-1.keyboard could be RGB  Overall experience- best pick if your budget is 68k
for gaming go blind...it gives me an average of 150+ FPS every time in VALORENT.bulid quality is very good.cooling system is very effective.best value in 65k (sale)it comes with nice professional looks.it has the MUX switch which is quite impressive in this bujet.... very satisfied with this Lenovo product.||For work and also for gaming.||This laptop is really good and also perfect for online classes and gaming camera is good,graphics are 5/5 but after I did the latest update for the laptop my speaker‚Äôs sound reduced a lot.||!It's an all rounder laptop for gaming and casual workSuper best

Better Beast üíØ I Am Experienced To Use Smooth Gaming Performance In Legion Ryzen 5 üíØ You Will Check Out
I got my laptop in May and it had auto restart issue from starting and since then I am contacting Lenovo customer care but they don't even know how to fix it and keep saying we are working on the issue.|_|price|:|I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast.||Buy this if you want an entry level workstation at this price.||Hate  the quality control compared to the premium price the laptop cuts from our pocketsThis is so annoying in the pandemic it really difficult if these types of things occurGuys, there is a serious issue with Quality Control from Lenovo I guess they are selling their defective product now as there aren\'t many stocks of this laptopDon\'t get me wrong the laptop is top-notch but these quality control issues make it worstI want a new replacement from Amazon nowI could have bought this laptop from a local authorized seller but they are closeI won\'t suggest any of my friends buy from Amazon and Lenovo products if this is the service and quality of products
Heres the thing, I\'m gonna be honest this is a great laptop but.......I got the laptop and everything seems fine and worked great, I did numerous tests and all passed except the dead pixel test.||Most reviews here are positive and for good reason the laptop is amazing but defective products are there and you might be the unlucky one, refund is always an option tho so go for it if you wanna test your luck at getting a good non defective piece.Edit: On the second day I found out that the \'ctrl\' key is also defective, I might get a refund.Also the seller I bought from is Appario, it was priced at 67990.Edit 2: Well I refunded it, as a customer you have the right to receive a near perfect device for the money you pay dont accept a defective product however small just cause your excited.Stay safe peeps.Edit 3: I uploaded the pic of the dead pixel, its so small and barely noticeable but still annoying to the fact I know its there even tho I cant see it.Edit 4: The 67990 price version is completely sold out as of this moment.||I watched movies in 2k hd are very good to see üôàConclusion:- Best laptop for this price 67k .It's good for gaming ,video editing and multitasking üßê.||Awesome product at this price rangeGood qualityPackaging was goodBUT.....my piece had a faulty speakerIt makes worst ever sound possibleI am not able to hear a thing from the speakerIts just disturbanceLuckily and fortunately they had me replacementBut it would take upto a month ...so sad
Laptop is awesome, I have tested few games for 3-4 hours, laptop didn't heat that much, was constantly howering between 70-75 degrees,I had order nitro 5 5600H laptop also, but had to return it due to one speaker not working at all just after 3 days( poor quality management from acer), got my refund and had decided to go with legion due to its premuim build and applause YouTube reviewers has given, and it didn't disappointed me even a single bit, speakers are loud, even 60% volume on this machine is louder than 100% volume of acer nitro 5Though acer nitro has good specs, their quality management needs to tighten things up, on the other hand Lenovo has impressed me to the next level, so if anyone is in doubt between Legion 5 4600H and Nitro 5 4600H or even Nitro 5 5600H, then trust me guys go with Legion 5 with eyes closed, this suggestion is coming from person who has used nitro 5 and legion 5 for almost 5 days each, go with legion 5 and you will not regret the decision, special thanks to Amazon and Appario for delivering this product quickly and in best condition.||It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries.||There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it.||I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this?||Literally, at this price its a supercar.||Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.||Great product for ~70k price point.||Amazon replaced it and the laptop is fantastic for the price.Performance is one of the best that you could get out of a 1650 and R5 4600H because of the thermals and ability to disable optimus.Battery is nothing to write a song about.||Overall a must buy laptop but with few years the GPU won't handle much of stuff., can't complain cuz we are in India where we are buying a 1000 dollar laptop for gtx 1650 where for the same price overseas we would get a 1660ti.||Packing was bad with tape worn out so I suspected foul play but it turned out to be packaging issue.On a side note: Kudos to Lenovo sales team for selling a 2020 laptop in '21 with higher prices than that of overseas.||Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment.||(Also instead of the usual selling price of 68k, the seller sold me this for 75k and I being in need of a good laptop bought this with no second thoughts.||Pls don't buy this if the price goes more than 72k.)||According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup.||I don't have much idea about technicalities but i know good graphics when i see them.At this price point it is absolutely worth it as it is a great gaming laptop as well as professional laptop.I like the look in particular because it doesn't look like other gaming laptops which look straight out of a teenager's aggressive wet dream.||Nice product at this price range built in qulity is good.||So nice deal at this price.||The ssd hdd hybrid combo is a perfect package of speed and size...im running all modern AAA titles smoothly and video editing is a breeze...takes only about 7 seconds or so to boot and whats noting is that since the display is directly connected to the graphics card this laptop is able to provide superior graphical perfomance than even its higher priced 1650ti and most 1660 counterpartsThe display is a treat to the eyes and i cant get ovee how great the laptop looks...the brightness is just perfect and ive had absolutely no issues with anything yet.||Everything is basically gliding in it
Received in excellent packagingAs far as purchase is concerned not a single time I have regretted this purchase for this price, laptop looks much better in reality than compare to image shown here,it does not look like gaming machine(this was my primary reason to buy it) it's fast, no lags,Amd ryzen 5 does handle all task with so much ease, it boots up in less than 5 seconds, does not heat up even after prolong use,keyboard is excellentOnly area where it could have been better was 1)battery expect around 2.5 to 3hours of backup battery2)camera it could have been better
It is a very very good and great laptop that I have bought from Amazon.||Worthy to buy ‚ù§Ô∏è
This beast is best at this price range.||Display is also good according to the price.In my opinion it is better the current gen ryzen laptop at this price range because they have some thermal issue or service availability is not good.||Got it for 63.5K on deal of the day , and it's worthy of the price.||It will still survive :)
It's the best nd beast at this price point", "Writing this review after 1 month it totally met the expectation the ryzen 5 4600h is a beast in the mid range performance wise far better than intel i5 10th nd 11th gen cpuBattery life-great for normal day to day usageRecommended to plug in charger while gaming..comes with 170W fast chargerComes with Lenovo vantage software with lot of extra features to customise & for optimisationDisplay- ips fhd with 120hz refresh rate is good considering the price pointBuilt quality is the best one in comparison to any other laptops of other brands at same price point...feels very sturdy no flex at allBelieve me you won't get such built nd design from any other brands even at higher price rangeYou can upgrade ram(32gb max) as well as the ssdThermals are great...doesn't heat up much even while gaming must say lenovo did a great job on thermalsAll required ports are availableIts best one to go with at this price point

Overprice at amazon.||I get this laptop in 62k in Amazon sale ,I will recommend this laptop over HP pavilion & asus tuf 15 because main advantage of this laptop over other is its thermal system its best thermal system i ever seen in such that price you will go with hap pavilion both are same but hp pavilion 4600 r5 is expensive than legion 5 but both laptop are good ignore asus tuf its thermal system is not as other two laptopPros- display is far superior than others laptop(120hz) in same price range and i already told you about thermals , keyboard is nice , build quality is good, it has its unique design as you see in pictures, speaker are pretty loud & battery backup is good i means its really good it includes 170w charger laptop have 4 usb 3 ports means you don't need extra hub , boot time is same as all r5 4600 laptopCons- weight 2.3 kg i know 2.3 is not heavy but once if you buy laptop then you will realize why i am saying this its heavy , design many of like that kind of design but some not if u don't like this design or you want leaa heavy laptop or you don't want Chinese product then go for hp pavillion 15 it is also good but little bit expensive
Most indemanding laptop in india for absolute reason.Pros:1.||Best in class thermalsCons.Not some muchBut india Variant comes with 1650 instead of 1660ti with same price tag in USA .||üò∞ very disappointing
No brand is giving you 60Wh battery in 65k, what are you waiting for just go for it, you won't regret it
This laptop is awesome I baught it in 67 in offline storeGive high fps in almost all games  üòç must buy if your budget is 70k batter then asus rog and tuf with same specsThe thermal is good never go above 65¬∞c.Over all best gaming laptop in this price üõê
Doesn't meet the expectations better to go for dell g series and Intel processor and is becoming sluggish.. better to go i7 or atleast i5
Gaming could be done at high settings with minor glitchoverall a good project as compared to other i5 machines.THE ONLY ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFEI KID YOU NOT BRUV!This has pathetic backup.||I really love the laptop and it is really fast too
I got this laptop in 65k and best laptop in this price range with amd ryzen 4600H so you can go for it, it's superb

I got my laptop in May and it had auto restart issue from starting and since then I am contacting Lenovo customer care but they don't even know how to fix it and keep saying we are working on the issue.|_|quality|:|But the battery charges fast enough as it is.Build quality: Legion is legion.||Hate  the quality control compared to the premium price the laptop cuts from our pocketsThis is so annoying in the pandemic it really difficult if these types of things occurGuys, there is a serious issue with Quality Control from Lenovo I guess they are selling their defective product now as there aren\'t many stocks of this laptopDon\'t get me wrong the laptop is top-notch but these quality control issues make it worstI want a new replacement from Amazon nowI could have bought this laptop from a local authorized seller but they are closeI won\'t suggest any of my friends buy from Amazon and Lenovo products if this is the service and quality of products
Heres the thing, I\'m gonna be honest this is a great laptop but.......I got the laptop and everything seems fine and worked great, I did numerous tests and all passed except the dead pixel test.||I am telling you my review on this laptop after 3 weeks of useüòå.Looks:- It have very premium design looks  like very professional not gaming  laptop üòäBuild quality:- It is made of premium plastic not metal , but very good quality üòå feels very goodSpeaker:- speakers are very loud and very good clear sound like doulby üòÇ(Harman audioüòå)Processor:- Amd ryzen 4600h is very powerful processor it is better than i7 also very good for gaming and multitasking üßê.Boot time is only6 sec.Thermals:- It's thermals are very good .||Awesome product at this price rangeGood qualityPackaging was goodBUT.....my piece had a faulty speakerIt makes worst ever sound possibleI am not able to hear a thing from the speakerIts just disturbanceLuckily and fortunately they had me replacementBut it would take upto a month ...so sad
Laptop is awesome, I have tested few games for 3-4 hours, laptop didn't heat that much, was constantly howering between 70-75 degrees,I had order nitro 5 5600H laptop also, but had to return it due to one speaker not working at all just after 3 days( poor quality management from acer), got my refund and had decided to go with legion due to its premuim build and applause YouTube reviewers has given, and it didn't disappointed me even a single bit, speakers are loud, even 60% volume on this machine is louder than 100% volume of acer nitro 5Though acer nitro has good specs, their quality management needs to tighten things up, on the other hand Lenovo has impressed me to the next level, so if anyone is in doubt between Legion 5 4600H and Nitro 5 4600H or even Nitro 5 5600H, then trust me guys go with Legion 5 with eyes closed, this suggestion is coming from person who has used nitro 5 and legion 5 for almost 5 days each, go with legion 5 and you will not regret the decision, special thanks to Amazon and Appario for delivering this product quickly and in best condition.||Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap.||Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them.||Its buttery smooth for each and every task you perform.The build quality, it was damn good and also the heat control of this lappy is insane.||BUILD QUALITY =>  It has one of the finest build  quality around this budget, it goes head on with  the Asus Tuf lineup in terms of build quality.2.||Will update if any response.4) Camera quality is bad.||build quality is top notch.||It barely runs for 2 hrs on balanced usage.Also the built quality is not great in this range and these are the areas where i think this product lags.My reviews are based on 3 months of usage.||I am writing for 2 days usages .Battery - 85%Standing 4 to 5 hrs without gaming.Speed - 90%Login and logout , page surfing all are goodDisplay - 100%Smooth looking and good to viewCamera - 75%Good in meet callsSound - 85%Slight noise is there but good oneHardware - 100%Matt finish , quality keys , smooth ports and keybord light nice lookingOS - 100%Original OS but MS Office is trail only not original that's disappointed lotOverall - 90%Go for it .||When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass.||According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup.||Display and sound quality is super awesome.||Games like CS GO, cricket 19 and F1 2020 run like breeze , you can code quite easily on this , handles all processes with ease, display is great , speakers are great, build quality is phenomenal and simple.||It will still survive :)
It's the best nd beast at this price point", "Writing this review after 1 month it totally met the expectation the ryzen 5 4600h is a beast in the mid range performance wise far better than intel i5 10th nd 11th gen cpuBattery life-great for normal day to day usageRecommended to plug in charger while gaming..comes with 170W fast chargerComes with Lenovo vantage software with lot of extra features to customise & for optimisationDisplay- ips fhd with 120hz refresh rate is good considering the price pointBuilt quality is the best one in comparison to any other laptops of other brands at same price point...feels very sturdy no flex at allBelieve me you won't get such built nd design from any other brands even at higher price rangeYou can upgrade ram(32gb max) as well as the ssdThermals are great...doesn't heat up much even while gaming must say lenovo did a great job on thermalsAll required ports are availableIts best one to go with at this price point

I am using this laptop for almost 4 months now i am very happy with my purchase.||If u are getting this laptop under 70k i will say blindly go for it
Its built quality is top notch, every ports are excellent, its cooling system, etc.||This is the best laptop is this price range.The build quality is far better compare to other this price or higher price laptop.The SSD is very fast and it's definitely improve laptop performance and also application performance.The processor is upto the mark.||I love the laptop build quality...It is really good among this segment..The battery life is average but it can be increased upto 6 to 8 hr if you put the laptop on silent mode as well as hybrid mode which restrict the dedicated gpu usage..so you can disable it just by enable hybrid mode in lenovo vintage app..The keyboard is really good.||Only 2 things that could hv been better are- battery life for normal usage is not enough(2-3 hrs) and camera quality could hv been better like its competitors in same price range.||Camera quality and battery is on the downside but it is manageable.My only concern is that the intake vents are comparatively big which supports thermals but also intake dust.||Screen goes maximum only 250 nits which is below average and there is screen bleeding which makes laptop hard to use in dark environment.Overall laptop and build quality is good but it is heavier than expected.The best thing is that thermal, no matter how much game you play it is never noticable
A perfect laptop for productivity and casual gaming don't think too much thermals are super fan noise is low
Rock-solid build quality for a laptop with a professional look.||The display, build quality and ports are amazing.||Heats a little bit ..eventhough it has cooling fans...ok performance ....picture quality displayed as 4k.....seeing almost kd colors.....@that price range ..it could have little bit better...||and microphone muted and not working pls careful to amazon as it is not right
