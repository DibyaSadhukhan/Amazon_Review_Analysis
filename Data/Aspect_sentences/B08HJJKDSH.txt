Good product
over the performance, it works like a charm for daily usage.heats a lot on longer usage, less battery backup, 3 hours max on high brightness.Sound is average, headphone works great as it supports Dolby Audiono comments on graphics as it has Readon graphics which is great for Gaming.||It's nice purchase but be warned of purchasing for online classes don't Volume is very low...Rest battery backup as mentioned not dat gr8.||DON'T BUY VERY SLOW PROCESSING", 'Very slow processing,even worst then a 2gb ramUsing this laptop from 4 months and found the system is very SLOW and the battery life is about 1-2 hours on heavy usages and around 3hrs on battery saver mode.Even got my laptop damaged but now fixed by a local service centerThey gave no warranty on physical damages.||Games are played while laptop is plugged in, if you wanna play on battery do not expect 6hr battery life and while doing normal work etc battery life is good
I can't say anything as I used intel Pentium earlier if was super slow and switching to ryzen 5 is like a boost.||Worst product, no battery backup although it shows a battery backup of 5 hours it hardly runs for 2 hours.||Very slow and battery life is pathetic
VALUE FOR MONEY!||Good for gaming.Just an SSD is needed to speed up
Do not purchase it , if you want a good battery laptop
Battery life maximum 2:30 and all is ok
