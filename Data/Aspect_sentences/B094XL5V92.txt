There is a discrepancy in the audio visual while playing videos.||While gaming the battery doesn’t last for an hour.||But Battery is so weak
Aside from it's moderate battery life, this gadget is a beast!||4 stars because the battery backup is pathetic , just attending online classes it stands hardly for 3 hr.||The only downside is the battery life which is pretty poor.|_|gaming|:|It really isnt that heavy at 2.3kgs and it can definitely be your long-term workhorse.A few things:The Screen:There is an option to go for the 140Hz screen but that would only be for extreme gaming use or if you worked extensively with color(especially color correction).||If you are gaming make sure you are plugged in.RAM and RAM Slots:The onboard ram is 2666Mhz 8GB.||Can double up for office use and a bit side gaming.||Awesome gaming experience but high end game need dissolves your juice very fast and you have to plug charger and playRest product quality is good and value for money I bought this for Rs 69990 /-  and with 9 months of EMI it went to Rs 74000 /-Battery is good if you are into working stuff but while gaming with 100 % charge you may play up till 1 hour after you need to plug the adapter

This laptop is like a beast for gaming ....u can play every game smoothly without a doubt...this is something gamers who play on laptops need....but everything has cons as well....i only encounter 2 cons :- 1) Cold front is good but they need to give small rubber stands or feet to lift the laptop a little up from back for coldfront to use properly....i cant find any suitable rubber feet or stand on Amazon nd even in lenovo store....2) Instead of 60hz they should have give 90 or 144 hz screen....60 hz is enough for 90% of games ...but 90 or 144hz give a little option that the hz will always be abv 60 or remain at 60 not less...i get 55 to 60 hz but not constant 60 hz
I did not get my intel master key

For past 10 days I am facing screen freezing, frequently system reboot.||If you are like me and don't like the gaming laptop look and want something professional from the outside and the beast in the inside , this one is for you .||Regarding the other specs , all gaming laptops have battery issues , it's upto you how you manage it .||In terms of looks, it is a gaming laptop with a professional touch ( can easily trick anyone).If you hve the budget go for it, if you can spend more, then go for the i9 configuration.||According to my requirements of having a gaming laptop along with keeping a low profile about it, this laptop can be used at office place.There are few drawbacks like small keypad and position of the webcam, which stings a little while using.The overall build quality is good.||As I got it for 66K, I think it is a must buy product, but I will recommend to buy a mouse for a better gaming experience.||U can view from any angle which is realy comfortable.Very compact unlike other gaming laptops
I have got a used piece, the laptop is good but it looks like it was used by the seller, can I know the reason
Excellent product to satisfy ones need, nice design in from top to bottom and entry level gamer can play AAA tittle games above 60fps at a decent settings.||While gaming the battery doesn’t last for an hour.||wrong item sent "Lenovo Ideapad" instead of "Lenovo Y540 gaming laptop"
Sound quality is not that good otherwise everything is top notch.||It's December 2019 launched product but stands relevantly ahead at this cost

I like how my gaming expectations are met in my budget.||I wonder why i chose this gaming laptop and not a macbook.Every other day it's drivers go haywire.||And not it's own keyboard has stopped working all of a sudden, and I've cleaned it, updated everything in it but no result.For gaming,.. aahh..play a game in this laptop and the fans will be as quiet as pin drop silence, and then open ms word and the fans go zzzoooommmm, as if I've opened 100 instances of the most heaviest games ever.Battery life is disgusting.||\xa0One of the best product I had!I have been using this product from last two months I had very good experience with this product.Nice processing speed.Nice gaming speed (graphic card)Wonderful display visible.||I bought the 1tb + 256GB VariantOne of the best laptops out thereGo for it without a second thought
i like the backlit keyboard and the system is very fast
The laptop is great for gaming and I use it for nearly 8 to 10 hours daily for my study purpose.||Battery life is great unless you are gaming, because you can play only for an hour and half then you need to connect the charger.|_|screen|:|Good screen.||The processor I got was 8th gen even though they advertised 9th gen literally everywhere.On the processor: I have taken a screenshot of CPUZ which shows the processor architecture to be 8th gen(Kaby Lake).||It really isnt that heavy at 2.3kgs and it can definitely be your long-term workhorse.A few things:The Screen:There is an option to go for the 140Hz screen but that would only be for extreme gaming use or if you worked extensively with color(especially color correction).||Most of the buying public would want to go for the 60Hz screen as it is a fantastic screen that wouldn\'t burden the small battery that the Legion comes with.The Keyboard:Pretty fantastic actually.||It is grainy and aimed right up your nose because it is placed under the screen.||Just aim the screen correctly and you should be good to go.||The screen needs a bit more nits.||I am still waiting on the replacement
