Best for students.||", 'Study but laptop battery is bad now laptop is not working because if you plug it instead of charging it will draining and it will off while still pluged
This is my first product of Avita.|_|camera|:|Only one problem is camera is in  bottom and small kids  like below 7th if they are using for online class they have to sit very near to laptop ... Or their face video will not visible.||screen is good everything else is average connectivity is even below average as it has only 2 usb ports nun of them is 3.0 and it does not have any lan port either, its only a wifi laptop.. all ports even 3.5mm earphone jack and charging all are placed on back with usb ports so it makes a bit difficult to access them while working.. and the webcam is also places above the keyboard so can not adjust it by tilting screen have to move the whole laptop.. ram and rom both are not expendable which seems idiotic.. don't know why the company did all these stupid things and made a good product below average they could have positioned the camera and ports on right places where they normally are and could have given option to increase ram and rom and this could have been the best product in range.||The camera position is  not on the screen and on the bottom panel makes it difficult to position during many scenarios.||Talking about the Laptop , I have been using it for the past 12 days , Battery backup is good, talking about the camera it is at the base of the laptop it makes a bit difficult to do any video call, Rest is good so far no cons observed, if we consider any laptop under this price range.||The camera is above the keyboard that makes use uncomfortable.||Only one problem is camera is in bottom.||good product.value for money need to change in camera
