battery|:|Pro tip, use hdmi out to a monitor and switch off laptop screen while playing games, it will give you little better FPS; as hdmi out gets feed directly from dedicated gpu (for laptop screen dedicated gpu\'s output goes through integrated gpu - read about mux switch which this laptop does not have)Only place where it lacks, is battery backup.||Gem at 70k budgetHaving issue with battery life as it last long 1.30 hrs on heavy usage and 2hrs on power saving mode.||The battery life is on the lower side.||Very impressive design and build quality performance is best in this price segment, sound quality is awesome and display is excellent also battery life is also normal, gaming performance is excellent no doubt
The media could not be loaded.||The device overall holds a decent look .But the hinge quality is not good .Its so soft that if you keep it in front of a table fan the screen would start shaking.No option for performance modes .Just traditional battery options in windows .The product comes with installed with omen gaming hub which is pretty useless ,since you can't alter performance with it.||First update BIOS,and windows.You will see good battery back up.Else you will see battery drains within one hour.I am not playing games.||Overall its all very well for gaming and professional stuffs like editing etc.But main limitation of this laptop is its battery backup which quite less than other brands laptops.....
For this price range, this is one of the best products to opt for if you are interested in gaming/online class/daily chores, basically for students and regular use.||AWESOME
Not bad.But no battery life

Laptop looks good.... but battery dies within one and half hour... maybe the battery defective... so I decided to replace this order..|_|gaming|:|So while replacing my years old desktop, thought of buying a so called "gaming laptop".||I understand for gaming I cannot expect back up like that, but would have liked around 5hrs backup at least for normal use like simple photo editing or browsing or using other productivity/office tool.Comes with 150watt power adaptor.||In normal use it is silent but while gaming fans comes on and they are noisy but not intrusive.||AFTER 10 DAYS OF USAGE:Perfect for gaming at default settings.||So you need to plug-in and play games for better gaming and FPS*
While the laptop is very expensive, the product is defective.||The speed and performance is good and can be used for multiple purposes other than gaming, like video-editing , photoshop, office work etc.||(Most compatible RAM for this model)
Best performance laptop under 70k.... better performance, good for gaming, good performance in Editing....||Battery lasts more than 3.5 hours with continuous useage with internet (without gaming and editing)......display was good graphic designers can go for it......No heating issues at all...speaker is clear, crisp and awesome it's a different experience on speakers..... hardware is quite good... Design as expected in pictures...(If laptop lags update windows)OverallGood for gamingGood for EditingGood for graphic designing
Very nice laptop...powerfull for gamming...sound and display quality is also good... running smooth... boot time takes around 5-8 sec... thanx to 512gb ssd... and the intel optane in superd we can use total of 40 gb as system memory
Probably the best gaming laptop you can get for this budget.||I didn't try this for gaming as that was not my intent of this purchase.||Very impressive design and build quality performance is best in this price segment, sound quality is awesome and display is excellent also battery life is also normal, gaming performance is excellent no doubt
