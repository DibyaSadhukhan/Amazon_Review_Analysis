battery|:|The battery life is very good.||As there is no further response from Lenovo, we are still doing continuous follow-up but the Lenovo team is unresponsive.Very poor service from Lenovo
Very nice laptop all is well but battery was only 4 to 6 hours
I loved the build quality of this laptop.||since the laptop is in intial stage of usage the battery is working as expected4.||I was looking for a tab cum laptop, with good amount of battery back up.||The battery performance is up to the mark(used for more than a month now).||Performance is good and sound quality is excellent.Display & battery could have been better.||Excellent laptop but price should have been around seventy five thousand.Pros:Fastness, good display, sound, premium looks, you will love 2 in 1 feature even if it's a new thing for you.Cons:1) Even though it's 1.4kg, feels a bit heavy2) battery drains fast.||Brilliant battery.||The build quality is top-notch, i7 11, touch-screen, foldable into pad, stylus and very good battery life.The machine works well for all applications but haven't checked much of its gaming prowess as my kids prefer PS4 over laptop for playing games.|_|screen|:|We purchased a Lenovo Yoga 7 laptop and Touch-screen stopped working after a week.||Finally, they decided to replace the laptop as the touch screen is not reparable.||The touchscreen further improves the user experience.||So instead of going for non-touchscreen models, please go for this.||It has good touch screen and display.||these kind of manual work can be reduced if you try to habituate  writting with pen on screen.3.||screen brightness reduction should have default limitations like we have in mobiles (this feedback is applicable to windows not for the laptop)
