Very fast booting process good quality but keyboard quality is not very good.||Camera quality is soo much poor and built quality is very weak.||I was surprised when I got the product, the laptop is sleek however the build quality is very substandard.||The keyboard keys and the plastic used is of very low quality.||Also, the keyboard quality is too bad.||The laptop works fast and downloading speed is superb......The problem is just this that the build quality of it is not good......I mean it can be pressed easily.......I recommend you all to buy this product

It's nice for daily day to day use for light work (as that's what I am using it for).||\xa01)Hp is the branded company2)hp is good for long term use3) no any laptop company gives 32 gb optane memory in this price range and because of optane memory my laptop is work fast4) it has 4 gb iris xe graphics so you can play all games and do all  graphics program5)its boot time is very lessü§©6)when I purches it so I dont know its alexa feature alexa is also built-in in this computerwith cortana7) it has ms office2019 life time support8)battery performance is very nice9) wifi and blootooth speed is also outstanding10)most easy for portable11)camera quality is also best12) only one thing is not present (backlit)13)its work faster than expectations because of optane memory14)free window 11 update available15) mcafee free antivirus is also available when I perches it16 ) an best thing is it is i5 11gen laptop so its performance is very nice
Performance wise is the best at its price.Upgraded to windows 11 already and everything seems to be ok.

The performance & all other things are good but only the keyboard quality is not at all good.||pls dont buy this Product it my experience off this product....
Good performance but batteries performance is very low while using any photo shop and other applications battery will empty very fast not it will not comes a hour and camera quality is also very low worst camera very disappointed warranty is already started before I buy the laptop
I bought it for 50k during offer,everything is awesome about lappy,value for moneyBattery 5/5Booting 5/5Build quality 4/5
Op in the chat Market value 59k but Amazon 54990k only discount on card also thx ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòä you Amazon
pretty good , using heavily for office and personal work since last 2weeks , working very smooth and got win 11 update also ,they should give the anti virus at free of cost
The Microsoft office activation key is missing.||Heating issue and build quality not that good.||\xa0Every thing is ok but Better to improve build quality, and add the backlighting keyboard
Super one
Super smooth function through octane memory
Likes : Speed and light weight.Dislikes: Keyboard quality needs improvement..
very quick functions.||Good laptop in this price
Pros: optane memory works great.quick bootup (takes only 6 or 7 seconds).Load heavy applications like autocad, revit , 3dsmax quickly (takes only 10 or 11 seconds).Great performance and quick response.I got 8GB 3200mhz ram .I suggest to upgrade ram to 16GB for better performance.Very thin and light weight laptop.Iris Xe graphics works perfectly.Cons: keyboard backlight is not availableSound quality is goodDisplay is good ( use an external display for getting  better colour reproduction).Camera quality is averagePosition of heat vent is right below the display .Better use a laptop cooling fan while using heavy programs.||Loading thing very faster.ConsBuild quality is not strong.||The seller give old laptopWhen I open the laptop there is already have another I'd ..but it is good

The laptop is very good but not the best.||The combination of i5 11th gen, 512GB SSD, 8GB RAM and 32 GB Octane memory is so good that all of the software applications together are working really great without any lag.3) The boot time and shutdown time is so quick.||It hardly takes 7 seconds when starting up and similar time for shut down as well.4) The weight of the laptop is too less.5) Awesome Sound Quality.||Just imagine what 100 level volume gives you.6) The features that are already provided like MS Office lifetime and the price that I obtained for are cool.Cons:The battery is not that good.||The specifications in the amazon product detail page says 8 hours, but it gives only 4 hours of good working time.||The technician was supposed to visit today but at the time of appointment he updated the system as problem resolved without even contacting me.||\xa01)Hp is the branded company2)hp is good for long term use3) no any laptop company gives 32 gb optane memory in this price range and because of optane memory my laptop is work fast4) it has 4 gb iris xe graphics so you can play all games and do all  graphics program5)its boot time is very lessü§©6)when I purches it so I dont know its alexa feature alexa is also built-in in this computerwith cortana7) it has ms office2019 life time support8)battery performance is very nice9) wifi and blootooth speed is also outstanding10)most easy for portable11)camera quality is also best12) only one thing is not present (backlit)13)its work faster than expectations because of optane memory14)free window 11 update available15) mcafee free antivirus is also available when I perches it16 ) an best thing is it is i5 11gen laptop so its performance is very nice
