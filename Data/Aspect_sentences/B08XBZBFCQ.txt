The laptop is sleek for its weight.||In battery saver mode you can watch downloaded videos for upto 8 hours.||In performance mode the battery drains up too quickly.||Everything about the laptop is near perfect, if battery life is not your major point of usage, go for it.||The battery life is decent but could have been better.||The battery is internal.||Pros:1) This laptop is value for money and have  the latest i5 11th gen processor.2) It is slim sleek and light weight, easy to  carry.3) Has narrow brezzels.4) Keyboard has backlit.5) Some people were saying that it haspower button on the left of power button  which makes them think that laptop may get shutdown while clicking delete but it is totally wrong as if it may get clicked by mistake then laptop won't get shutdown we need to press windows button+power button to shut down.6) Fingerprint is very fast get log in 1 sec.Cons:1) It doesn't have backlit in spacebar.2) Battery backup isn't that good as it has  41wh battery.3) laptop doesn't open single handed.4) camera quality is not that good but it isn't a major issue as all laptop except surface books and macbook have bad camera quality.5) touchpad is a little rough but again not an issue you will get habitual towards it.||I recommend to buy this laptop if you are looking for decent battery life, great performance and fast and smooth user experience.||There are four modes of battery but \'best battery life\' mode also drains quite fast.Now coming to the two big problems:1.||Fingerprint scanner, audio speakers, battery backup are all fine.||*Fast charging, 20-100% in 1 hour 15 minutes, 20-80% in 40 minutes.Cons:*It is mentioned in the specification, it has 8 hours of battery backup for video.||The battery is really great.3) Display 7/10- It is not that great, if u are working near a window or some light falling on the sceen, it gets difficult viewing things.4) Performace 9/10- The 16 GB Ram and the i5 11th Gen processor is superb, have never experienced lagging till date.5) Editting 8/10- Have been using Photoshop since a month, and the 2GB Graphic Card performs quite good.||Don't purchase product is not good", 'While changing time touch pad current passing it is  waste product

The laptop is sleek for its weight.||So it was time to upgrade.My options were a Macbook Air with M1 chip with 8GB RAM, or Windows 10 with 16GB RAM.||That comes as a surprise the first time when you open the computer.||That is what I would expect from a mid range Windows laptop.The booting time is pretty fast.||Boot in almost no time.||After pressing power button you will be logged in by the time you finish saying "Ready, 1, 2, 3, Go".||So if you forget to switch off the cooling pad, it would continue running the whole time.||So every time you will have to locate this to switch ON the laptop.||The speakers however are below and the sound might get muffled at times other wise the sound quality is great.Battery backup is average, don't expect it to last more than 5-6 hours.||*Less than 3 seconds boot time.||So i will give my opinion on the following factors.1) Design 9/10- Medium Weight, very aesthetic look, the Silver colour is the one i have and it looks really stunning.2) Battery 8/10- I use the laptop for around 5 hours a day, and i need to charge it only 1 time.||Only clear cut issue is blue light filter switches off if screen times out.||Don't purchase product is not good", 'While changing time touch pad current passing it is  waste product
