battery|:|Don't buy this, all the great specs are useless if it doesn't start!Update 13/09: I gave it for service and they are saying the battery and motherboard is defective and they need to replace it!||It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone?||The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced!||Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase?||( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45°C .||No "Fragile" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the "Contains battery" warning.A Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop.||Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me.||Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.Close to 10 hour battery backup after full charge.||Battery is not for heavy use.... Additionally I didn't see any charging limiter so using while keeping on charge may degrade the battery.... Somehwat unlike other laptops...||\xa0received unit is faulty - fingerPrint, power button and battery are not working properlyIssue with the received unit:1. after using it for few hours the system got struck and made a noise and didn't work for a long time and then i force shut down it and opened it.||the battery life shows very differently some times it gives 7hr and sometimes it's 2 hr even after the battery is fully charged(green light is indicated for full charge) for almost the same kind of workflow.3.||I was looking for one with a good display that will help me work without the monitor connected.2) Battery:With a moderate use, battery performance on the first day was really good.||Build quality is awesome too.. battery life was decent for my working (around 7-8 hours) over all for 68k it was a steal deal for me..||\xa0The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p  low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps .||I\'d suggest 60Hz for slightly more battery though.Now onto battery.||Takes some time to charge from 80-100, I think it\'s to reduce the battery degradation over time, so it\'s a good thing.||Also youtubers suggest not to charge your laptops above 80-90% for the same reason so it is good.Now the usage I got for the entire 100% of battery, till the laptop shutdown by itself at 3.2k (native resolution) and 90Hz refresh was around 8 hours of screen time.||On same resolution and 60Hz I easily get 6 hours on just 80% battery(this is how I normally use the laptop, to stop battery degradation)The camera quality is better than most, and mic has a good capture range(no noise cancellation or anything so picks up your background easily).The headphone jack is good and it also letsnyou select headset/headphone.IT IS NOT A GAMING LAPTOP.||It has really nice precision touch driver suport for multi finger gestures which are handy to use.Final verdict: if you want an absolutely gorgeous display with light weight, sturdy, full aluminium build for productivity tasks or just college with entry level FPS gaming and good battery life this is the pick for you.||Must go for this
Superb build quality, awesome screen, and the main highlight of this laptop is its design, it feels very premium, battery backup is also very good i got 8 hours backup in normal usage and 6 hours in heavy usage.||For the battery I get somewhere around 5-6 hrs.||For me Noo.Battery life - i setup and updated all updates and downloaded software and surfing while connected to wifi for 3.5 hrsThen transferred my old pc data to this still connted to wifi and meanwhile twerk some settings also for around 1hrAnd watched 2 movies in vlc player (skipping emotional scenes) for around 3.5hr and after these all laptop remain with 18% battery.So overall battery performance is more than sufficient for me 7-8 hrs in 30% brightness and used in one before better performance mode.I'm sure if you drain batteryfrom 100% to below 10% you can easily get 9-10hrs of browsing office work (word excel and all) or even programming with browser with 30% brightness.For brightness its good for in doors and i even don't have any problems in using outdoor so it depends on person.Overall OP OP LAPTOP 👑🔥

So, I was pretty excited to get this laptop near launch since it looked quite good from all aspects except for the decision to stick with Intel.And well, in a nutshell—this ain\'t it Chief.||THE MO-EFFIN\' DISPLAY!Seriously, HP/Dell/Lenovo should be embarrassed for shipping displays in this day and age that can\'t even support the full sRGB gamut!||The display on this laptop though, is a home run in all aspects.||The addition of 90Hz is also appreciated, the UI is a lot smoother looking that way and I say why not expect all this, when we\'re getting beautiful high-refresh displays in mobile phones?||The overall build is quite decent except for the display frame which flexes so be careful.Oh, and I am so happy to report that you can open the laptop lid with just a finger!!||The fingerprint reader doesn\'t work, there are no Linux drivers for it as of now.Verdict:---------I want to applaud Xiaomi even though this laptop has some big red marks, because I think at this price point, you\'ll find it hard to get a laptop that\'s tailored for productivity/day-to-day office work with such a good display.||The 3.2K display is just amazing.||Of course we are purchasing this laptop for productive work not for clicking selfie's 😅.Now a days almost every people have smartphone with high resolution cemera and best quality speakers.Bunch of specifications this laptop have...like3.2k Display, WiFi 6, light weight easy to carry, battery back up uoto 10 hours, Irix graphics card, 89.2 screen to display ration ..and many moreSo over all this laptop is value for money product people can definitely look for this, in this price rang people might not be able to found other product with this type of specifications.|_|quality|:|Pros:1) Build quality.2) Display (best I have ever seen amongst laptops).3) Keyboard, great typing experience.4) Fingerprint, lightening fast.Cons:1) Sound speakers downwards, would have been better on surface.||Overall product is good, but charger is missing in package, and web cam is very bad quality
There's volume and KB backlight fix for this laptop to get loud sound!||Superb build quality.Trackpad is also good,Didn't check the games yet will update the review after one month of use.Programming purpose this is the best Laptop with good display.Booting is very fast and it will open the screen in 5sec with finger print access.Cons which I feel1.even though it is 15 inch lap it doesn't have number keys at right side of the keyboard.2.Volume of the speakers is very less for spending 77k.3.||Camera quality is not good.4.||Seems Xiaomi compromised on Charger , quality is ok don't know about the durability and also on charger it shows other brand name

No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price.||The build quality is super premium with Aluminium.||The China models complaint of severe throttling with temperatures reaching 100° C because of that.Cons:-1) Xiaomi should take quality control seriously.||Exceptional build quality.||Got it delivered today, the build quality is great, display is amazing.||Hope it works for others.Happy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.Rest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.||Are they giving cheap quality hardware packed in a high quality build???||some times while opening the system the authentication will not ask for fingerPrint it directly opens, i thought it quickly recognized the fingerPrint as soon as it system opened but while restarting the system also observed the same issue.at last, the build quality, the screen, and the specs at this price point is great but you need to get a good working unit.||I felt really cheated and this is not what I expected from Amazon nor Xiaomi
Everything is fine i doesn\'t like 3 things in it they are1) Touch Pad is Not up to the mark it\'s not giving any premium feel and not nice.2) 2×2W Speakers are very low.3) Charger inside the box is not the Xiaomi branded Charger they are giving other company charger named "LITEON" Brand.Rest of that everything is fine
Pathetic quality.||Best possible clone of MacBook in your budget.I tried to install MacOS and shared this photo with my friends and they thought it was MacBook 😂Pros -1) Metal build2) Battery backup (my case 6-7hrs)3) Display quality with 90hz performs really well for editing4) Wi-Fi 6 has great connectivity and has thunderbolt 4 portCons-1) It would be great if it come with Ryzen variant and 2gb graphics card2) Intel iris xe donot performs well in high end games (tried watch dogs2)3) the velcro for binding the charger wire is little small and can have problem while binding the wiresOverall it is a good clone for MacBook which comes in a pocket.||I felt it's more effective when it's kept on a surface than we keep it on lap.5) Performance:Performance wise there is not much notable difference from those of others with the same specification3) Others:Fingerprint, keyboard, mouse pad are also impressive in the first instance.My take: Overall a good, worthy and budget friendly product when compared to those in the same category!Thanks to Amazon too, to deliver it quickly and to give an option to buy for a day when the stock is up
The laptop has been proven to be a superior machine in terms of quality and performance despite a competitive price there has been some compromises to reduce the price such as absence of dedicated GPU, a card slotbut for a normal user like me it should not matter much so I'd give it a 4.5 stars a best buy itself, xiomi has created an ecosystem now and I've become a part of it
I bought this on 8th Sep.||Build quality is awesome too.. battery life was decent for my working (around 7-8 hours) over all for 68k it was a steal deal for me..||\xa0Display is crisp and clearPerformance is good tooDrives are good tooFingerprint is awesomeFront cam is above average (good)Build quality is premiuim (macbook feel)But Xiaomi lacked few things which I noticedThere's no OEM Windows disk included or atleast they should attach a link on their website where all drivers are available.There's no support assist app which can help in installation of drivers, like dell have dell assist and every other brands have that.Speaker quality is good but it's not loud unless you turn off DTS processing app.External graphics card is supported thanks to Thunderbolt 4 but there should have one more option with discrete graphics card for civil and mechanical engineers.This pc can handle casual gaming but for heavy gaming it should not be your first choice.||It comes with a 65w usb c charger which is around 200g, it\'s of standard quality and the usb c connector feels sturdy.||The only problem with build quality i feel is that the rubber feet aren\'t that sticky.||On same resolution and 60Hz I easily get 6 hours on just 80% battery(this is how I normally use the laptop, to stop battery degradation)The camera quality is better than most, and mic has a good capture range(no noise cancellation or anything so picks up your background easily).The headphone jack is good and it also letsnyou select headset/headphone.IT IS NOT A GAMING LAPTOP.||keyboard looks good but compromised with build quality (sturdiness missing).3.||Very fast charging, fast processing speed and amazing display but sound is very low and camera quality also not good but yet value for monay.||Must go for this

So, I was pretty excited to get this laptop near launch since it looked quite good from all aspects except for the decision to stick with Intel.And well, in a nutshell—this ain\'t it Chief.||Its webcam is very nice, it give a fair quality of video.||This laptop do everything and any type of work very smoothly and easily you can do it on this mi notebook ultra..Camera and speakers quality is slightly low but that does not countable.||Of course we are purchasing this laptop for productive work not for clicking selfie's 😅.Now a days almost every people have smartphone with high resolution cemera and best quality speakers.Bunch of specifications this laptop have...like3.2k Display, WiFi 6, light weight easy to carry, battery back up uoto 10 hours, Irix graphics card, 89.2 screen to display ration ..and many moreSo over all this laptop is value for money product people can definitely look for this, in this price rang people might not be able to found other product with this type of specifications.|_|speakers|:|Pros:1) Build quality.2) Display (best I have ever seen amongst laptops).3) Keyboard, great typing experience.4) Fingerprint, lightening fast.Cons:1) Sound speakers downwards, would have been better on surface.||Unfortunately, I have never seen good speakers in mid range laptop.||Mac speakers are definitely good, but with a price tag.Overall: Value for money.Yet to test:1) Battery.2) Performance.||SAD, I bought it under the impression I could buy mi extended warranty after purchase of the product :(
Excellent laptop for productivity purpose and watching movies( with external speakers 🔊).Display is awesome and Laptop feels very premium.||Superb build quality.Trackpad is also good,Didn't check the games yet will update the review after one month of use.Programming purpose this is the best Laptop with good display.Booting is very fast and it will open the screen in 5sec with finger print access.Cons which I feel1.even though it is 15 inch lap it doesn't have number keys at right side of the keyboard.2.Volume of the speakers is very less for spending 77k.3.||(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)you also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.cons:-1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications  it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.ohk so that was all form my side
No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price.||Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.Low sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.||My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers.||Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre.||The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny.||This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.The webcam and the speakers are also totally useless.||Hope it works for others.Happy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.Rest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options.||Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb freeIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.Can use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.Fingerprint sensor and power button combined.Good loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.Lifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software.||But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.Default sound output from speakers not loud enough.||I worked for nearly 5 hours (out of which 2 hrs of zoom calls) and 50% drained.3) Camera:Camera is just fine for video calls, not bad actually as it's used mainly for video conferences or online classes etc.4) Speakers:Inbuilt speakers are fine for the above mentioned uses.||maybe 16 gb varient will give 60 to 90%.4) Charging while using it takes around 3 hours.5) speakers are a little bit low but i didn't faced any problem as i always use earphones or headphones.6) heating i didn't faced any major heating issue.I tried 4k video rendering and valorant but the temperature never exceeded 80°C .||Everything is great except for inbuilt speakers, which produces very less sound, especially while using on bed.||I wanted to test this laptop out of curiosity to introduce internally for our managers and consultants.PROS:Well designed Laptop with soft keyboard with backlit functionBrilliant 3K display unparalleled in its class and rangeWell packaged Specs under Rs.77,000 (Inclusive of taxes)Reasonable weight (though not light as LG Gram or Apple Air) considering its sturdy buildGreat aesthetics (Reminds you of Apple Macbook Pro)Good and quiet performance (Does not heat at all as it has great insulation and fan to vent out heat)Great performance for running office and many other applications.CONS:The touchpad should be as good as what's available in Apple Macbook ProOptions to buy with dedicated Graphic Card for UX/Graphics users.I strongly recommend this product for almost all purposes
Charger is of average quality and the speakers are not up to the merk honesty.||Till now i didn't find any unexpected issue from the if in future i will provide an update
Except for poor speakers everything else is awesome.||Very slim, looks nice and professional but bulky
Pros: great display, fast finger print scanner, nice build quality, aluminium body with nice design, good battery life.Cons: speakers are average, it can get scratches on body easily.you can play games on it but it gets heated.||Heating is managed well and fan kicks in on higher load.Camera and speakers are average.||Contrary to popular belief, I found speakers okay5.||My model is i5 / 16GB Ram / 512 SSD
I like to say that its a perfect laptop for person who wants to use a premium product at a affordable price ....only thing I feel that definitely need to be improve is speakers and charging support with mobile charger
Everything is good but sound quality disappointed me!!||Lastly speakers are not loud.||Core 17 16GB.Excellent Notebook...
Value for money product, laptop speakers are underpowered, build quality and configuration available is best for heavy to moderate usage, speakers are low in volume,needs improvement.||Nice laptop at 56k ..16gb varient
Super product in the budget....if you go for same configuration in any other brand need to pay 40k extra... except speakers everything is great.... speakers are your basic need.... don't go for it....||I kinda wish Xiaomi went with the 6-core i5 but given the bad thermals, that\'d prolly make things worse?Another aspect that suck for me, especially coming from a MacBook 13", are the speakers and battery.||It\'s big yet it sucks.The speakers are just terrible.||I REALLY HOPE Xiaomi continues to iterate on these laptops, fix these flows:- Ditch Intel, give us AMD which will give more cores, better value- Improve the cooling- Better speakers- Better trackpad- Proper drivers/support website- Better BIOSThe Windows laptop space is long overdue for a revolution and I think Xiaomi is well-positioned to make big waves like they did with the Redmi/POCO series back in the days.||This laptop do everything and any type of work very smoothly and easily you can do it on this mi notebook ultra..Camera and speakers quality is slightly low but that does not countable.||Of course we are purchasing this laptop for productive work not for clicking selfie's 😅.Now a days almost every people have smartphone with high resolution cemera and best quality speakers.Bunch of specifications this laptop have...like3.2k Display, WiFi 6, light weight easy to carry, battery back up uoto 10 hours, Irix graphics card, 89.2 screen to display ration ..and many moreSo over all this laptop is value for money product people can definitely look for this, in this price rang people might not be able to found other product with this type of specifications.|_|price|:|Mac speakers are definitely good, but with a price tag.Overall: Value for money.Yet to test:1) Battery.2) Performance.||(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)you also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.cons:-1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications  it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.ohk so that was all form my side
No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price.||So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges.||no light in  worst experience from xiaomi .when you buy a product for 64k price you expect from that .. and in just three days😡😡
I just received this laptop earlier today.||The 3K display at this price point is just nuts.||ProsGreat price to value proposition.||Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .||some times while opening the system the authentication will not ask for fingerPrint it directly opens, i thought it quickly recognized the fingerPrint as soon as it system opened but while restarting the system also observed the same issue.at last, the build quality, the screen, and the specs at this price point is great but you need to get a good working unit.||Pros:Great display..Great speed...Great metallic design...Great performance....Highly responsive fingerprint scanner..Typing feels marvelous..Battery backup satisfactorily upto 3hrs.. (we cannot expect much at this price range)Cons:Numeric keypad is absent.Speakers are down facing...||Hence you won't feel that much sound.Grill vents in the downside of the laptop are bendable which I quite personally hate so much.Overall:Wonderful product at this price range.||I felt it's more effective when it's kept on a surface than we keep it on lap.5) Performance:Performance wise there is not much notable difference from those of others with the same specification3) Others:Fingerprint, keyboard, mouse pad are also impressive in the first instance.My take: Overall a good, worthy and budget friendly product when compared to those in the same category!Thanks to Amazon too, to deliver it quickly and to give an option to buy for a day when the stock is up
The laptop has been proven to be a superior machine in terms of quality and performance despite a competitive price there has been some compromises to reduce the price such as absence of dedicated GPU, a card slotbut for a normal user like me it should not matter much so I'd give it a 4.5 stars a best buy itself, xiomi has created an ecosystem now and I've become a part of it
I bought this on 8th Sep.||It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront.||\xa0The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p  low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps .||The Laptop is the best in the price range.Pros- Performance, Build Quality, Display, Battery, TrackpadCons- Keyboard a little Flimsy with a little flexThe sound problem can be resolved by playing with the DTS Control Panel.||Even though it has a price tag of 64k, it is definitely worth the buy.||\xa0The screen display is top notch, unbeatable at this price range.||Super laptop in this price the display is extraordinary super display keyboard is super and fingerprint is also very fast overall good product all round laptop expect for gamers this laptop see like apple macbook 😍
MI Notebook Ultra (The latest series launched in July/Aug 2021) with 15.6 3k display, 11th Gen i7 Processor, 16GB RAM And 512GB SSD is simply superb.||Awesome laptop for the price.Display 9/10Performance 9/10Build quality 10/10Battery 6/10Audio 6/10Webcam 7/10The audio and webcam are decent and good enough for video calls.||Mso2019 & windows 11Great:Build qualityDisplaySpecifications at the price pointBattery life is 8hrs medium usage (+-2.5 for low and heavy usage) daylong battery.Performance with respect to price.||I bought i7 15.6" , for the same specifications any other brand the minimum price will be around 85-95 K. Performance is smooth no significant glitches in my 10 days of use.||Excellent price rangeNegatives:1.||However, I found nothing wrong with the product so far.Summary:Excellent laptop for office use at resonable price (havent tried games at all)

The media could not be loaded.||Fingerprint is so fast display is too good.Spearker volume is not up to the mark
Very smooth and comfortable, premium Quality at that price point.Fully Satisfied.||My model is i5 / 16GB Ram / 512 SSD
I like to say that its a perfect laptop for person who wants to use a premium product at a affordable price ....only thing I feel that definitely need to be improve is speakers and charging support with mobile charger
Everything is good but sound quality disappointed me!!||At this price you cab go with Mac
It's like a led TV with 4k resolution...awesome performance.||only problem is that i cannot take extended warranty for this one
Liked it, good battery and brightness
GOOD PRODUCT
It's Wonderful....
Over priced....and some accessories should be included along with laptop such as pen drive or alexa
It's a good product", 'I got some 3rd party charger which is lte and other than that it is really a good product worth it
Not so happy with keyboard It feels like cheaper.||Really liked the laptop....worth the price and brilliant build quality.||But it\'s no productivity champ either with just 4 measly cores Intel decided to add at this price point.||I wished the battery was a bit bigger to get 6-8 hours but maybe I\'m asking too much at this price point?The trackpad is trash.||The fingerprint reader doesn\'t work, there are no Linux drivers for it as of now.Verdict:---------I want to applaud Xiaomi even though this laptop has some big red marks, because I think at this price point, you\'ll find it hard to get a laptop that\'s tailored for productivity/day-to-day office work with such a good display.||It\'s a daylight robbery what HP/Dell/Lenovo is doing, pushing subpar laptops at this price point when Xiaomi here is able to make a point that you can indeed provide great bang-for-the-buck laptops.||I highly recommed this laptop to you because it is very difficult to find a laptop with this much specs at this resonable price.I bought this laptop in Rs53000 because amazon gives so much discount for this product.||Of course we are purchasing this laptop for productive work not for clicking selfie's 😅.Now a days almost every people have smartphone with high resolution cemera and best quality speakers.Bunch of specifications this laptop have...like3.2k Display, WiFi 6, light weight easy to carry, battery back up uoto 10 hours, Irix graphics card, 89.2 screen to display ration ..and many moreSo over all this laptop is value for money product people can definitely look for this, in this price rang people might not be able to found other product with this type of specifications.|_|
