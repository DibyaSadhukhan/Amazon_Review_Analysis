Value for money
First if you don't know it does not have windows 10 it is a dos laptopSecond it does not detect ssd or hard drive as you sayI've returned my laptop and it took 15 days timeJust bad product of all timeIf you receive this product with a detected ssd or hard drive and no windows 10 then get your windows installed for under rs1000 (he will say that windows is not genuine but get it done because laptop companies also dont use real windows 10 as it costs 15k and if only windows costs so much then what is left in laptop for 38k) and boom this laptop then is crazy.Just return it if does not detect ssd please
