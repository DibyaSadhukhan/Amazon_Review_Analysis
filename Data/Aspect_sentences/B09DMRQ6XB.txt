speed|:|Transfer speed from usb/hdd to laptop is good.7.||Transfer speed within HDD from one drive to other is 2-5 Mbps which is ultra low.8.||When I took it to the service centre they asked me to put one more device in it for better speed.... That was worth rps 7000....i already spent do much money on this laptop and still I need to add more items to it for better functioning...||i did not see any lag in speed.8.||No pre-installed MS office
Performance is good as using from couple of months..highly recommended
Very good product as per price very smooth operation light weight dont believe on negative reviews this is fantastic product for daily usage

As I have used the product since it is received and I have experienced and noticed that this product is awesome and  recommend to all to buy this product if anyone wants to purchase, I have only noticed that build quality of outsideframe is not strong and need to be improvement on Laptop body
