Mujhe pasand nahi aaya avita laptop
Best budget laptop!||Glad that he had it taken back.Ideal price of this laptop should be around 13k.||N4000 processor is useless even for basic browsing and multitasking.Best deal in this price range would be Acer one 14 which is rock solid and a business class laptop.||Product is ok and not expecting anything better than this price.||People who have bought laptop pre covid 19 has void the warranty period and now service charges are as good as 50% of laptop price.||At this price we are getting a good laptop it's enough and good for just small office work and loved it thank u Avita
Value for money it is good and comfortable for home purpose.||This laptop is so AwesomeLet me talk about it benifts firstIt has good performance,Supporting All basic features like Ms Office,Tally Erp 9, And Other Editing softwares,u will fall in love with its LARGE full hd display(😍),128gb + 4b gb Ram,I have been using it For 1 monthNo problems yet ...But Doesn't hasBacklit keyboard..design may not be that good but okk...(Also if u want  can get it modified like Apple)Now let's come to the conclusion:-Please don't Go by its name that  It is made in china and new company..  because its a very good product.... in this price range can't find any good laptop than This one...its one of the best laptop(As per my experience)|_|screen|:|Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it.||The issue was with the display that it had a dead pixel in the center of the screenHave used for a 2 hours only for diagnosing and all.||While working in mspaint the mouse pointer suddenly jumps anywhere on the screen.||Very good laptop for 15000 I bought it for 5700 under exchange.For browsing and simple official work only and email check best laptop the screen resolution 1240x1920 good one for you tube and movies
Bad choice, screen is not effective, hangs , machinery and system over all is ineffective, keys don't press properlyI am bound to keep this since Amazon refused to take return or do replacement, all that money on this laptop is a waste now as this laptop is a show pieceNot at all recommendedThis feedback is a comparative feedback from other machines I have
If you ever plan on using Microsoft Excel, stay away from this laptop and brand.||Than another day the windows suddenly showed blue screen and had to fix the same with BIOS boot order change.||The screen is top quality, similar in quality to that found on many top-end models.||It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats.The speed of the laptop is very good.||Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge.All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this.The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen.||If u look at camera then u cant see screen and vice a versa - for online school also children may face issue of battery and camera position
Below are my verdicts compared to the price I bought it (₹17,150)# Well built, nice looking, slim and light weight# Windows 10 built in, though in S mode, but S mode can be disabled with latest Windows updates# Decent performance for few light weight multi tasking, such as web surfing, playing songs via media player, documents editing, connecting to remote desktops.||It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K
Within 4 days of use, the right hand side of the screen turned blank, see attached photo.||Display size, screen resolution and sound are great.The minor drawback I feel is about the camera's location.||Probably to support the enough screen size, it might be placed just above the keyboard and bottom of the screen.||Cute and LovelyI bought this mainly for its SSD hard discHighest resolution which you can't get from anyother laptop of this price and this screen sizeIt's a great idea that they've provided all the USB port, charge port, audio port behind the laptop.Works excellently with my favorite ubuntu OS( I removed windows)I don't use laptops for gaming
At this price the product is a bargain.||Booting is fast and screen quality is good.||Webcam position is awkward and makes you look like you're rolling your eyes as you look at the screen during a video call.Build quality is questionable, but there are bound to be tradeoffs.||The lid of the laptop bends fully backward if you tilt the screen more than 90 degree angle.||Only thing you might check if it suits you or not is the placement of the webcam (its present very near to the key board, unlike other laptops where its placed on the screen bezel.Solution: Just by using a laptop stand the position of camera can be adjusted as needed.||So unusually its camera is in the lower part of the screen.||Usually its at the top pf the screen.||It is light weight(1.2 kg) small screen (14 inch) portal computer.||Totally worth your money.The screen quality is Impressive for this price.||Value for money  laptop is so good and everything is fine  but audio quality is not so good  overall product is  best for basic work
Picture quality very nice, but slow in even conducting online classes, web cam quality is ok and it is placed very low, when you are in video con you see the screen but others look you as watching at 30 degree above from the level.||Normal laptop has camera on the display screen and you can adjust it below.||Cam placed in bottom of screen that will get bad frame while taking pic or at video meet.||After 12 day its screen is not working.||It got issues here and there almost everywhere.... Wifi battery and all
It’s a daily use laptop for working and watching movies with sharp screen but may not be the best for gaming
Awesome screen quality, very good battery backup up to 3 hours, no heating issue,
Good laptop..... Go for it... No competitor in this price range
Good for small office use  but very fragile
It's been 15 days now and I haven't face any challenges, there is no voice of a fan and even it won't get warm.||I have line in my screen and am unable to download my warrenty card.||Screen Quality and laptop service very poor quality and no one help to screen repair laptop has warranty but no support

Outstanding Product.......Excellent Amazon Service....Thank you  so much Amazon...||The camera is placed at the bottom of screen.||Only dealbreaker is the full HD screen and SSD but this can be upgraded anytime later.||The AVITAL laptop is worst, wastage of money and time, dont buy it, the camera is just above the key board not with screen which wont allow you to adjust it as per your convenience.||I unbox the laptop and the laptop screen was full of Scratch and one key was missing .the wrost laptop I have seen I have two laptops that I buyed from Amazon but this was terrible.||Awesome display.. slight bleed in lower left corner but barely noticeable..no dead pixels.. almost bezel-less screen18.|_|money|:|Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it.||Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money.Expecting gaming and editing etc.||All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.Pros-1- IPS Display 9/102- SSD 9/103- 4-5hr battery backup 7/104- Design 8/105- Build quality 7/10Cons-1- 3.5hr of Charging time2- Charger Quality3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money.Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for.||great Laptop at this prce point..1) great display2)good processor not for gaming those who wants gaming not this laptop buy 30000 or highe price laptop but asphalt 8 runs smooth3)ram also ddr44)128gb ssd apps load fast and boot time 10 second5)so light waight ..battery backup 3 hours  on 100 percent charge..At this price point no other brand offer such a value for money laptop.........
Review after using for 4 days.Pro's -1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class.2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot.||I lost my money in buying this waste product

I would suggest not to buy this laptop, my Avita laptop battery suddenly stopped working after few months of purchase.I logged service request but they will give you so many excuses and delay the process.||If you have tight budget buy it at your own risk, if it stops working after month you have wasted your money, No service at all..
Its really amazing guys, its built quality is enough for the day to day work.|_|
