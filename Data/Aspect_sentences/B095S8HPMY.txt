Camera quality.||This is best if you are having following requirements -- Professional and slim laptop- Long battery backup- Touch laptop with stylus pre boarded- Video/Photo editing 4K- Medium Gamings (PUBG PC with medium graphics 60fps)- Fast SSD write speed- Long lasting hinges, as this is 2 in 1 also that's why beautiful and perfect hinges required.Though it is having screen bleed issue, but that's ok it happens with every laptop you won't observe but it happens in other brands also (Mac, Or Anything like that) - Just try to tighten the screws, mine is good till now except for small 30-45 mm bleeding in bottom left screen but it's negligible.And rest maintenance is upto you, I'd suggest buying 14 inch sleeve rather than laptop bag to have a good laptop care.Also you can apply antiglare Matt screen protector - 14 inch.||The screen of the laptop was not working when the time of delivery and while replacing the order the delivery person was not accepting the product
