quality|:|Although, backlight keyboard has become a compensation... very disappointing that there is no fingerprint sensor or backlit keyboard
Keyboard quality could have been better.||Overall laptop is good and has a good performance ratio in its league but camera quality is very poor .||Though you get 60fps streaming but quality is only around 1 mp which is heartbreaking
Will add more details after using it for a while.||This laptop meets my daily requirements surfing and excel sheets and good to have 512 gb ssd at this price range
Nice colour, it is fast ,good battery backup I expected to have more loud speakers in it ,,audio is good quality,,not bad can be used for simple works for call center job etc not effective for software Engineer work
Affordable product with best features in this budget but I think i5 processor is most better than i3 sooo if someone have any extra budget go for i5 processor thanks Amazon
Great design, love the speed, I have 8gb,512GB, it is super amazing

Pls go for this product.||No light in keyboard big problem in night use in leptop don't purchase in haste this is an important very big problem
Battery backup is too poor as see in photos.||But company claim that backup is upto 5hours but it has only 2-3 hours backup.||Overall Its good, but battery backup is very low once fully charge done approx.|_|warranty|:|The product is OK but the lenovo gives only one year warranty and the amazon is telling that it will give 1 year additional warranty from amazon end.||their warranty is just a fraud .You would not be able to get repairs later as they won't pick calls and their technical support won't come up.||Ssd with i3 11th gen is must.. 2yr onsite warranty is real deal.. work execution is really fast.|_|
