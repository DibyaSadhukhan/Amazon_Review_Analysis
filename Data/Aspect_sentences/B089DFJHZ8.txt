The media could not be loaded.||Booting time, image quality was as expected.||Laptop build quality is very very bad,metallic look is only a illusion you can clearly see in photo there is no grill inside laptop to prevent motherboard from dust.I seriously think it will not last more than 1 year.Moreover if you are concerning it to buy for video recording don't even think of it as most of the softwares like obs don't take graphic card below 600 and it's 350.You will definitely going to regret it after buying.I wish there might be a return policy but as per policy it's only for replacement

Worth to buy
For professionals
I was apprehensive about buying a relatively new brand in laptops and after extensive research , i decided to take the plunge .I am super happy  with it for the following reasons1) small, sleek and really light2) High end configuration3) Superb battery life, lasts almost 3 days with my typical usage4) very quick start up5) Good VFM considering the competition
I bought this laptop a couple of months back, not from amazon though.|_|keyboard|:|No lifetime Microsoft office.No in built camera.No backlit keyboard.Track pad is cheap in construction.No carrying bag provided.Type c port doesn't change notebook.Provided charger is heavy on weight.The list goes on...||Keys on the keyboard don\'t offer any resistance.||Some of them mentioned about the lack of an in-built camera, the notebook getting hot during gaming & the processor\'s thermal throttling kicking in, its RAM being not upgradable, its touch-pad being little mushy to operate, lack of a back-lit keyboard etc.||Moreover, I am a touch-typist who doesn\'t need to look at the keyboard while typing.||In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery.||So, a back-lit keyboard was not a priority for me.Secondly, I am not a gamer, and even if I were, I would deploy a proper gaming rig for the purpose, and certainly not a 14" portable notebook.||The left and right mouse buttons aren\'t demarcated on the surface of the TouchPad, which assumes the shape of a single rectangular area below the keyboard.||The keyboard is neatly laid out, and is very comfortable to touch type at full speed.Coming to the screen, the display is indeed an eye-candy.||I am also glad to see that despite its size and weight, the notebook has plenty of ports including a Type-C port for data transfer and charging, an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack.but there is missing from the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is a microSD card slot and Thunderbolt 3 supportDidplay is also too good..in speaker there is no too much voice but good not bestkeyboard is good for me but if u need backlight , backlight is not therei love the performance of laptop just take few sec to openit's barvo..and the weight of laptops extremely lightthat's why i also like it..for me there is only one problem that is speaker.||It doesn't have a backlit keyboard.||I and my friend decided to buy Xiaomi laptop, We both are having issues with the laptop✓ Low-quality Components, Heating issue, Suddenly Touchpad Stops Working, Keyboard Stuck while working✓ Sound of my iPhone XR is more than this laptop ( CHEAP SPEAKER IN LAPTOP)✓ battery backup is just 4 hours but Xiaomi claim 10 hours of battery, my 5 years old MacBook air has a better battery backup✓ keyboard feels itself  like cheap quality keys✓ laptop comes with old age charger ( never seen in notebooks )I don't feel there is anything special to pay a huge amount of 60,000I'm unable to do work on this laptop because of many issuesI lost my money, I'm thinking to sell it out and buy new ASUS laptop
Guys please buy this only if you can work on only day time.||You can’t work in night no backlight for keyboard and this is productivity laptop ha ha .2.||This laptop deserves all the Five Stars.The Spec that MI has offered is Amazing while keeping the price almost half to their rivals for Lappy with similar specs.It seems to be silly that the list of cons posted by others like no inbuilt camera, trackpad and keyboard.||Nowhere MI has claimed that they have a backlight on the keyboard & there is a camera in built.||After one month of usage the laptop is giving notifications that the Windows license has expired.The keyboard of the laptop and the key travel is a mess.||It’s in the middle of the apple an HP keyboard.||i bought this product thinking that it has a i7 10th Gen processor but seems like it is useless as other hardware is pathetic.I try to load a game and it restarting every time when I try to run the game.after some time use its mouse pad stopped working.Really a big disappointment
Combine macbook pro & dell XPS 13 and voila you got your self a mi notebook 14 horizon.Although I didn't received webcam bundled in box probably got dropped while shipping raised concern about it they didn't provided me another thats why giving it 4 stars other wise everything is great listed down some pros & consPros :1.Light weight smaller form factor2.Premium look & fill3.Powerful enough to to handle day to day task4.Doesn't heat up5.Bezzel less display looks great6.Charging speed is fast with bundled chargerCons :1.No backlight keyboard2.No room for upgradation eccept SSD3.Display brightness fills lacking while watching content
I bought this product just 10 days back and sparingly used.||Xiaomi is good for phone not for leptop

Good configuration.||This is an extraordinary product, awesome performance, disadvantage was backlit keyboard...||No backlit keyboard.||Only cons are no keyboard backlight.||All features is good except for the speaker sound.its very less.u need to have additional speaker fitted if u want to enjoy the songs
2 cons:Trackpad makes filmsy soundNo keyboard lightTip: Change DTS settings to improve built in speaker performance

Before purchase, I went through several reviews of MI Horizon 14" notebook.||Some of them mentioned about the lack of an in-built camera, the notebook getting hot during gaming & the processor\'s thermal throttling kicking in, its RAM being not upgradable, its touch-pad being little mushy to operate, lack of a back-lit keyboard etc.||I also noticed that even the rating system of Amazon India requires the customers to rate a notebook based on the quality of the in-built camera, and as to whether the notebook could be used for gaming.||But then, I had my reasons when I went ahead, and bought the Core i7 version of the MI Horizon 14" notebook.I believe that while buying a notebook, one has to be clear about the purpose.||Style comes close second as a priority.My use for the notebook is for office document creation.||In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery.||So, a back-lit keyboard was not a priority for me.Secondly, I am not a gamer, and even if I were, I would deploy a proper gaming rig for the purpose, and certainly not a 14" portable notebook.||So considerations of gaming did not affect my notebook purchase.I prefer using a Logitech Full HD webcam for video-conferencing, as it has been my observation that webcams built into the notebooks usually have poor optical performance.||Xiaomi \'s own survey had shown that a webcam is not a priority for most notebook users, but this was before the COVID-19 pandemic (You see, the Chinese did not see the pandemic coming!||😜).As to the RAM being soldered on to the motherboard, many brands are doing this to reduce the thickness of the notebook.||Providing RAM connectors on the motherboard not only adds to the thickness of the notebook, but also adds potential failure points.||Removing RAM connectors from the motherboard and directly soldering the RAM on to the motherboard shaves off some cost that could be deployed elsewhere during notebook design.||Besides, 8 GB of RAM is abundant for my requirement, and when the need for upgrade comes, it will be of the notebook and not of the RAM.||Therefore, soldered RAM was not my concern!The design emphasis in MI Horizon 14" notebook is on minimalism.||There aren\'t a plethora of blinking LED lights as one would notice in some Fujitsu notebooks.||The bezels of the screen are super-slim, and the notebook\'s lid can be opened with a single finger.The TouchPad is also minimalistic.||It is far above in quality compared to several other notebooks which boast of a Full HD screen.||I would only say that I could effortlessly edit the RAW imagery from my Sony Alpha camera, thanks to the bright display.Overall, a stylish all rounder notebook, provided you are aligned with its design philosophy!||Good design build quality super Mi laptop supports direct casting also need to choose Nvidia graphics  by default graphics set to UHD graphics and also need to set custom audio sounds For better audio output choose user and then enable all Encahces modes along with traditional mode settingsCons :1.No backlight2.Ram expand not possible as soldered to mother board3.touch pad is slight need to improve4.No HDD slot and only 2gb graphic card5.Speakers are located bottom if it was on top  it might good
in notebook horizon  I love the sturdy aluminum unibody chassis.||Weighing at just 1.35 kg, the notebook is slim and extremely light.||I am also glad to see that despite its size and weight, the notebook has plenty of ports including a Type-C port for data transfer and charging, an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack.but there is missing from the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is a microSD card slot and Thunderbolt 3 supportDidplay is also too good..in speaker there is no too much voice but good not bestkeyboard is good for me but if u need backlight , backlight is not therei love the performance of laptop just take few sec to openit's barvo..and the weight of laptops extremely lightthat's why i also like it..for me there is only one problem that is speaker.||I and my friend decided to buy Xiaomi laptop, We both are having issues with the laptop✓ Low-quality Components, Heating issue, Suddenly Touchpad Stops Working, Keyboard Stuck while working✓ Sound of my iPhone XR is more than this laptop ( CHEAP SPEAKER IN LAPTOP)✓ battery backup is just 4 hours but Xiaomi claim 10 hours of battery, my 5 years old MacBook air has a better battery backup✓ keyboard feels itself  like cheap quality keys✓ laptop comes with old age charger ( never seen in notebooks )I don't feel there is anything special to pay a huge amount of 60,000I'm unable to do work on this laptop because of many issuesI lost my money, I'm thinking to sell it out and buy new ASUS laptop

If you buy any hp/asus/apple/microsoft you can get anywhere service and all parts are available in local markets but in this case my display damaged and only through service center the replacement done with Rs.12211/- I feel sorry for this
I bought this MI notebook horizon I7 3 weeks before and the performance is good.||Amazing notebook.||Just go for a better laptop like lg gram or lenovo  idapad slim 5  just terrible
Mi notebook horizon edition worth for money.. i7 10 gen, but thy could have given integrated camera, no windows word pre installed, and key board lights missing.||I read it in specifications as Windows is included but it is asking to activate windows nowWith in 15 days after buying notebook mother board gone and service Center people ordered the same.||Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much- The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age- The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook’s 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board- The audio system on the notebook is weak.|_|
