The laptop has great built with all the required specs and ultra light in weight.|_|battery|:|The battery life is not that good.||The battery is very good easily last around 9 to 10 hours for general usage.The things I don't like is the stero sound is bit tiny but inbuilt sound app somehow boost the sound.Palm rest area is a bit small for large hand you don't feel small for long typing session.I think RAM is soldered into motherboard so you don't have the option of upgradebility.Overall I love this laptop for my general usage web browsing, streaming media and connecting to my 4k TV for large screen experiance.||I am satisfied with this product.Pros:Light weightSturdyNo lagGood battery backupPowerful enoughConsLittle hitting issue in the air vent.||And battery backup is a charm.||Battery is also great for people looking for full day battery backup.Track Pad can be improved upon in next version.Overall a great package for people who are looking for ultra light laptop with long battery
