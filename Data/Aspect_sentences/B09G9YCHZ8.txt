The Laptop is Good in general and overall.It is very fast in boot up & shut down in less than 15 sec.The given windows 10 with Office is very Good with several update features.Several minor inconveniences are there as follows : It comes with single 256 gb SSD and in it windows would ever need more than some 50gb.Leaving that Lenovo should have created a part of 200gb as separate virtual disc for user convenience and safety of system.But they left it as single open disc.For General users it will be hard job to create a virtual disc needing expert services .This system can accomodate one more SSD for increasing storage capacity but no where details provided as required for user how to install it.They should have exclusively provided info on this.All 3 usb ports + HDMI port all inline beside power adopter point at left side.Seems like a design for left handers.Such like this provision is not convenient.For cable mouse left to right cable has to run around for a Right hander.It boasts of a finger print reader in power button but no where it is mentioned how to set it.Other than these points well satisfied with this Laptop and hope it will give expected service life.||Don't buy Lenevo Product, bad quality and worst service", "Laptop ðŸ’»got dead within a year that with very nominal usage only for e-mail checking and on line school class that's it.Service center confirmed its motherboard issue...they didn't attend service after having product under warranty that too onsite visit...even giving excuses over phone one after another.Importantly, they asked lots of queries If customer buy product online from Amazon etc...even don't recognise online issued valid invoices on registered products.||And feels like the govt era service standards by Lenovo.||The worst service.||Battery - GoodWeight & design - GoodCamera - Not so goodSSD experience - Gooooddd...
