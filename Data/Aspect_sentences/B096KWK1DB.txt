battery|:|But yesterday when I checked the laptop after receiving its delivery,  to my utter dismay,  the battery of this laptop is found to be defective.||Man that low considering this is a 70k laptop.Battery - Battery kinda good considering it is a gaming laptop thanks to iGPU mode and other battery efficient options.Camera- It doesn't have one.Display - Nice display not the greatest one but a decent one.Sound- I just use it with my headphones on, So speakers doesn't matter to me.||So the latest adobe versions can be run smoothly without any problem in this device.The only small problem is the battery life...its give around ony 4 hrs of normal useage..||Been using it for around a week and a half now, so far the experience has been good, I've faced no issues or inconveniences and everything seems to work well.Some good things about this laptop are the battery, the 144HZ refresh rate monitor, armoury app and the keys to change fan speeds manually.The GPU in this one seems underwhelming since it's an RTX 3050, even though it performs better and has additional features than the 1650, it still doesn't feel like a massive difference.||using it after 2 weekspros..1.awesome battery life around 7-8hrs2.good screen3.keypad and trackpad is good .||i like it whole except battery it has some little battery issue
Please note that the TGP given is just 60W, which will not give the RTX power you want.||Holds battery for long time as expected.||The battery seems to be fine, and the speaker sound is okay.|_|fps|:|I played Valorant i got 70-80 in Top setting where he got 144 fps and it also has screen bleeding issuesPros-Laptop Body looks good and its attractiveCons-Screen bleeding since the day i got it 🥺-Fps around 70-80 in valorant in RTX 3050 but got 140+ in 1650ti 😶-While playing it in Turbo mode the heat comes through the keyboard and overheatNB :- If you have 70k you can look for another best laptop its a gross
Screen display is having white spots, called Amazon guys and arranged a technical visit which didnt happen at the selected time slot and the ticket got completed without technician visit.Again raised a complaint, submitted pictures but no avail.||I play valorant at 60 fps without any frame drop and the cooling of this laptop is awesome.. Just place it on a stand and it would be much better.I mainly use this device for editing works...||For me this is a huge upgrade since I was using a pentium laptop and getting around 30-50 fps in most games but now with this I have anywhere from 60 - 250.||Do not hesitate to buy an RTX 3050 if you have this tight budget, it is certainly future proof since it's a new arrival though I would highly recommend you get your ram upgraded to 16GB as soon as you buy this, it'll help avoid dissapponting fps.||like 110fps in valorant in high setting and 60-75fps in warzone in recommended setting(single 8gb ram).cons.1.||Nvidia gpu is used only to drive external monitors and render frames in the background for intel graphics.Performance is good on external monitor(300 fps in csgo 1080p high) compared to 90-110 fps on laptop screen.||🤝 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
