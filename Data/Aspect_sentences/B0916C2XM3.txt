battery|:|The battery backup is okay.||No  battery is enough for me.||So battery will always run out after 5-7 hours depending on what I use it for.||Yes no battery is enough for me.||battery life⭐⭐⭐⭐Light in weight⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
It's my kid in ukg uses this lap mainly for her studies.||\xa0Everything is pretty good, nice product at this price range but battery backup is pretty low.|_|camera|:|The camera feels like 1 mp but the sound quality is truly out of the world.||It is a VGA camera, which is not of much good use.||For virtual meeting, i need a better quality camera.Keyboard is not backlight, but it doesn't matters much for me.Speakers are good.||However, one thing that disappointed me is the web camera.||Asus could have provided a decent camera with this laptop.||I think Asus is best model comparatively
Very good laptop but camera is very poor ......
Pros :A good choice for normal users.|_|quality|:|The camera feels like 1 mp but the sound quality is truly out of the world.||For virtual meeting, i need a better quality camera.Keyboard is not backlight, but it doesn't matters much for me.Speakers are good.||Best screen quality⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Max 5 hr.||Picture quality of Web Camera sucks.||The laptop is light weight and the screen quality is excellent.||♥
Laptop is goodBut my laptop started showing vertical lines from 2nd daysOn fouth day when pickup arrived it had 7 lines appeared
Viewing angles are not good, performance is good and built quality is also Average.Overall ok ok product and not a gaming laptop.|_|hdd|:|256 gb is enough and it's expandable with another ssd or hdd slot (like a 512 ssd or a 1 tb hdd)2  this is not a gaming laptop.||The 256 gb is ample for me because my desktop has 2 tb space and I've an additional 2 tb hdd external hdd.|_|gaming|:|256 gb is enough and it's expandable with another ssd or hdd slot (like a 512 ssd or a 1 tb hdd)2  this is not a gaming laptop.||So realistically it does better gaming than expected with it's given hardware (as a gamer I would always suggest a strong desktop for core gaming)3 .||As i am not a gaming person, so cannot comment from that point.||♥
