Laptop is good and perfect.....I thought at the laptop is screen ...Then I got replacement also but the reality..On battery power by default the laptop set to 60hz when ever you Plug in it changes from 60 to 144hz and when u plug out 144 to 60hz so this is why it 2 sec time screen gets off and on.....No issue in it....If you want to get rid it means right click on desktop and got display settings and goto advance system setting change 60 to 144hz then your laptop will 144hz during on battery power also then screen will not off...*Performance - 5/5*Display- 5/5*Battery- 4/5 on normal usage 3-4 hours  easily we are getting
Don't worry about its quality and specs in this price segment", "The media could not be loaded.||\xa0All thing is good sound quality is nice but not so loud , camera is below average, booting time is awesome, heavy but very thin laptop battery backup is ok , the dhansu RGB backlit keypad is awesome and also wasd keys are highlighted, I haven't tried a game yet so I'll edit the review for performance impreasion in some days.||\xa0Laptop screen turns off after running for a while and then comes back on
I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Watch Dogs 2,Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2,and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great,everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e,gaming.Now for the cons..this laptop gets waaay too loud while gaming.I use headphones and i can still listen to the noise if the volume is low.I was using a PC before so i havent experienced this kind of sound.Now comes the battery backup which is absolutely pathetic.U can barely use this laptop for 1 hour 30 mins while doing normal stuff.The backup is very bad.The other problems i faced is that the adapter gets waaay too hot and i mean it,way too hot while gaming.I plugged it in for 3 hours while gaming and it gets so hot that i almost couldn't touch it.I have to stop between my gaming sessions and unplug the charger for it to cool down which is very frustrating since i was using a PC before and never had to face this kind of problem.Now comes the camera.The camera is...bad,just bad.I would never use it for anything,i would rather use my phone camera for meetings and other stuff.So in conclusion this laptop is good for gaming while plugged in,but for watching movies with backup power,its not great and u can watch only a 2hour movie at most.I would give this laptop a 7/10.||\xa0First purchaseI am facing this problem ( when switching on the power the screen is going black for 2 sec and again when going back to battery same thing is happening ) and the asus customer care executive are saying it's default because of 144 Hz.After ReplacementSame issue is prevailing.My experience with ASUS is not at all good.||Overall I loved display, battery life and speaker.||So I didn't feel any thermal issue.Only one drwaback that is it's battery life but we didn't expect battery with gaming laptops so it's  the only issue else when you plug in it to charger it's screen got off for few seconds and when you remove charger again it's screen going off for few seconds , First I think it's a detactive after that I call service center they told that when you plug it  to charger then it's display using 144 Hz and when you remove charger it's screen using 60 Hz that's the reason of that, you can resolve this problem by going to display setting > Advanced settings > and their a option 60/144Hz.||But 144 Hz consume more battery .||Asus tuf f15 1650 ti modelFor gaming , for normal use, very thing is beastGTA 5 running smooth at high graphics...no heating issue ...no lacking issues... battery comes for gaming 1.30 hrs for gta 5 high graphics for normal use comes for 3 to 4 hrsThis is not led display this is lcd display..but display colours and quality also goodIT has 3 ssd slot :-1 .||3rd slot that is sata ssd slotTotally worth for 64k for normal use and gaming alsoBest laptop ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It's a fine laptop but the problem I got whenever it switch from battery power to AC ( or try to charge the battery) there is flicker in screenEthernet connection is good but wifi is not as good as ethernet if you connect to a wifi router after sometime connection will terminate automaticallySpeed is good but not as good it advertising may because of less cache memoryIf you play game only then battery is bellow average for multitasking it is good.||I can say thatPros:144 hz display1650 is neatRGB is a nice touchSSD boot times are goodI couldn‚Äôt get any good games to benchmark but it gave around 60fps on max on Genshin since it‚Äôs capped on 60 FPS.Armoury crateCons :i5 is ehThe battery life is mediocreThe temps go up to 90c sometimes it‚Äôs usually around 75-85 so it‚Äôs not half badThe camera is average
The media could not be loaded.||Eye light sensitivity is incredible, doesn't harm eyes if you look at keyboard under RGB effect for couple of minutes.But the battery....  i don't know, this being my 1st laptop buy, I recharged it fully while doing windows setup,then let it drain entirely while setting up windows stuff and the recharged it again.||So I am not rating any star for gaming.I will do hardcore test, Will definitely give more review in coming days regarding gaming and battery.For the time being Overall product is a Good Buy.||It's battery life is very good when ur not playing any games but when playing playing games the battery will drain in an hour or so.overall I played Minecraft,fortnite and GTA V the fps are good and the laptop does not heat at all.||Great entry/mid level gaming laptop, excellent build quality and ergonomics, of course don't be expecting great battery life on this but it can hold up to about 3-4 hours easily (not while gaming though), It can pretty much run any AAA titles on medium at 1080p 60fps (Can crank up some older games to high/ultra) with no lag whatsoever and that 144hz refresh panel while playing FPS games like Doom or CSGO is so satisfying!||\xa0laptops performance so good but one genuine issue battery backup only 2 hrs backupIn product description: mention time 6,7 hrsSo if you want battery backup don't go for itI am only disappointed with battery issue
The media could not be loaded.||On battery its good but battery drain fast while gaming when not plugged in (charging)No heating on laptop body but inside its about 60¬∞- 90¬∞ thanks to fans in laptop that keeps it cool.Laptop body is strong but don't know if its scratch resistant.If you are going to use it for work which includes designing or photoshop the display is not made for it.No finger print unlock and face unlock.camera is 720p but not good.If you want to do gaming in low budget go for it.||The finishing and materials used is very good as it is tuf series.The overall performance is good in this segment the main drawback is battery life is too less around 2 hrs with compare to the others, upgradibilty is good option with 32 gb of RAM, 1 ssd and 1 hdd.||\xa0been using this from 3 days nd i have to say the build quality of the laptop is top notch although its completely plastic build but feel sturdy nd premium as well now talking about the performance oh man oh man as i mentioned this machine is beast this is meant to give dhasu performance in every aspect now as this is a gaming laptop so it can run most of the game without any stress but one thing i didn't like much the battery performance nd the web cam bit also this is gaming laptop so i can understand about Battery so the conclusion is if you the budget nd your looking for a gaming laptop with closed eyes go for this you will never regret this is the best gaming laptop under 60küòé‚ö°üî•
The battery lasts about 55 to 70 minutes maximum.Even in general usage.Laptop is sturdy in built but the battery life of less than an hour is disappointing with the normal browsing.This sounds a good deal until you start using it and battery disappoints you every 40 mins.||\xa0Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source.||it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine.||Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....||For browsing and online classes, the battery may last upto more than 3¬Ω-5 hours on full charge.||But the baterry is on average..
A product that stand near it's promises,if you're mid range gamer then this is your laptop for sure.screen quality isn't that good in sunlight,About battery life as you can see any laptop you buy for gaming don't give you that much battery while playing without charging
Very nice laptop but only bad thing that it has a very short battery
This is first day of my Laptop, The Look and Body is what i was expecting it to be, the speakers are very good and loud ..but a little disappointed with the loud noise of the fans even in silent mode, in turbo its like a hair dryer,writing this as this is my first feel of the product ..have to check about battery and performance.||wifi6 4gb graphics etc.No Cons Till Now.For battery it is decent as you get in all laptops

The laptop is very decent for gaming, but the battery is the main issue for me althought the camera is very bad aswell i will overlook that, the battery only lasts for about 5 hrs on battery saver mode while the advertisment was upto 9hrs of video playback but when i use chrome to watch youtube or other things like amazon prime the battery barely lasts for 5hrs

What could I say more, it's awesome laptop, excellent performance for gaming, heavy coding and for other video related editing works, got this around 62k, good colorization and everything's great, screen is awesome no worries such as screen bleeding.||Im not a gamer so i can't comment on gaming side, but as a programmer, it can handle heavy lifting with huge IDEs in parallel and also multi threading programs are so close to my server.||Great entry/mid level gaming laptop, excellent build quality and ergonomics, of course don't be expecting great battery life on this but it can hold up to about 3-4 hours easily (not while gaming though), It can pretty much run any AAA titles on medium at 1080p 60fps (Can crank up some older games to high/ultra) with no lag whatsoever and that 144hz refresh panel while playing FPS games like Doom or CSGO is so satisfying!||Overall a great portable gaming station....||\xa0The touch pad is came outside when i press it it goes to normap and after 2 minutes it comes outside again
Coming with a decently equipped hardware, the specs on this laptop are a treat for those who are buying this as their first gaming laptop.||On battery its good but battery drain fast while gaming when not plugged in (charging)No heating on laptop body but inside its about 60¬∞- 90¬∞ thanks to fans in laptop that keeps it cool.Laptop body is strong but don't know if its scratch resistant.If you are going to use it for work which includes designing or photoshop the display is not made for it.No finger print unlock and face unlock.camera is 720p but not good.If you want to do gaming in low budget go for it.||The laptop speed/performance/display/graphics is good.A bit bulky but then 15.6 inch gaming laptops are not very mobile anyway
A pack of awesome-ness from asus.||Amazing laptop for the price, if you want to go for a budget gaming laptop this should be your go to, upgradability is also very good with empty slots for easy upgrade of ram and ssd
Excellent performance in all respects.||\xa0been using this from 3 days nd i have to say the build quality of the laptop is top notch although its completely plastic build but feel sturdy nd premium as well now talking about the performance oh man oh man as i mentioned this machine is beast this is meant to give dhasu performance in every aspect now as this is a gaming laptop so it can run most of the game without any stress but one thing i didn't like much the battery performance nd the web cam bit also this is gaming laptop so i can understand about Battery so the conclusion is if you the budget nd your looking for a gaming laptop with closed eyes go for this you will never regret this is the best gaming laptop under 60küòé‚ö°üî•
The battery lasts about 55 to 70 minutes maximum.Even in general usage.Laptop is sturdy in built but the battery life of less than an hour is disappointing with the normal browsing.This sounds a good deal until you start using it and battery disappoints you every 40 mins.||\xa0Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source.||it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine.||Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....||Great for gaming with different software adaptation modes.||I'm not a heavy gaming type but i used it for video editing , coding, and programming...||But the baterry is on average..

I m writing this review after 2 weeks of laptop use,Laptop perfomance is good but battery life stay for 2 hrs max with normal use.||Upgrade the ram to 16gb as it's a sweetspot for gaming, multi-tasking...... although without it it's still the budget king....||This is TUF
Very nice gaming laptop in this price üëç üëç  üëç üëç , only the battery life was short, otherwise very nice.....||So far in use for about 1 n half month and no problems.. games like apex legends, farcry5, forza4, days gone run above 70 fps..and the 144hz really ia amazing for multiplayer overall its a good gaming laptop but interms of battery gaming it only gives 30fps and does not even last for 1n half hour for gaming normal coding and offc work it will last for 2 n half or 3 hours.. but it gets kinda hot while big games.. its okay if the room temperature ia maintained.. id definitely suggest in this in this price warzone only gives 55-60 fps in medium settings but in low it can boost upto 70 fps.. for a 60k laptop its great, valorant above 130 fps
Great productSmooth like ButterPerformance like Beast
Buy it without any second thought for gaming.|_|performance|:|Great performance on heavy audio editing software.2.||Battery performance is ok.||I must say it now ..the laptop lacks regularity in performance....during my office works, it stops running and screen get black....then after some time  it starts repairing processes initiated automatically without permission.....my  work got deadlines but thanks to this lappy...its dead now....One last thing to say to amazon...please check product working before selling...people buy products from your app not from retailers... trust issues are going to pits thanks to such sellers.||For a normal user the display is crisp and punchy.2)performance is top notch for 1080p gaming i get 144fps constant while plugged in valorant (this is the only videogame i play.||And its really fast.Cons-1) Due to rgb keyboard and 144hz display the storage option on this perticular model is 512gb and for higher storage option u have to go for the more expensive varient.2)The storage here is 512gb but after all the windows installation and bloatware from both asus and microsoft we are left wits around 418gb which may seem a lot but isn't enough for a power user like me.3)Asus's armoury crate in this laptop is pretty much useless as there aren't many customisation options available.there are only performance customisation which i think also customise the fan speed and rgb customisation which include only 4 options as its one zone rgb keyboard.4) camera on this laptop is straight up trash though it claims to be 720p but the video is really grainy even in good light.5)this may be nitpicking but asus claim this laptop to be military grade durable and i doubt that as there is flex in deck as well as screen.||\xa0I bought this product 2 days before and the product which was delivered to me was the worst defective peice ...the speakers were damaged and not producing the full sound ..it's recorded in phone that's why it's loud but in love the sound is not good and the voice is not heard and the surrounding sound doesn't works and the battery life drains in low performance i.e within one hour ...||\xa0All thing is good sound quality is nice but not so loud , camera is below average, booting time is awesome, heavy but very thin laptop battery backup is ok , the dhansu RGB backlit keypad is awesome and also wasd keys are highlighted, I haven't tried a game yet so I'll edit the review for performance impreasion in some days.||Getting close to 50-60 fps on high setting in AAA titles, and some with 30-40 in ultra setting.The laptop is a bit noisy during gameplay but is silent when performance is not need (daily tasks and surfing).Good job to Amazon for delivering me this laptop under 2 working days!!||Beautiful outside and inside, great display, good performance while gaming.||Must use a laptop stand with fans while running on turbo mode Armory crate in asus is amazing for switching in between performance silent and turbo as per uses.||It gives a very high performance even on charging4.||Buy this laptop, if you really just need an i5 over the current processor you have (I had an i3 7th Gen) and a dedicated graphics card (I didn‚Äôt have) over an equivalent 11th Gen as the prices are much lower now and performance gains are hardly around 10-20% more.||In a few months, once the 12th Gen series arrive, this laptop will simply be a no go as those offer better security other than simply performance gains.||It's not glass so I don't expect Macbook level smoothness.SSD- Very fast boot speed.Performance- The performance is excellent.||ASUS should look into that as it is mianly used by students so MS Office is a critical feature for the students.For gaming, i would suggest 60hz for such games which don't require too much usage, but for heavy games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and many newer games switching to 144hz with laptop charging on will give you best performance.||I review it after a month , performance is great there is no lags in display the built  quality is also superb you never feel it's plastic body, it,s like a metal which is good.||So all the performance and quality is good you can buy without hesitation.||I would say overall the build quality is far better with this price range it has military grade tested acknowledgement, when it comes with performance its too supportive for high end software.||Display is really good with 144hz refresh rate.Backlit keyboard is a very good touchBattery back up is decentBoots up in 4-5 seconds

Very nice laptop.||\xa0Best Display :-Fhd at 144hz is just a eye candy..Anti glare coating does not strain the eyes neither gives headache...its super smooth cuz of 144hz..but not for video editing or content creation because of its 45% ntsc color panel,AUDIO:- Speakers are just awesome...No Regret...Additinally Asus gives so many audio features so its just dope...u can definately feel the audio coming from 360¬∞BATTERY:-Charges in an hour ...and lasts for 6-7 hrs on normal usage in silent mode on performance mode battery backup drops to about 3 hrs which is normal.||(not High).With some tweaking you can enhance the performance and it will boom the performance.It\'s better than Lenovo and Acer similar range laptops as it has better build quality with more versatile keyboard and functioning.Everything runs like a butter on this "Tuf".And by the way, what importance does a laptop have if it is not "tuf".||\xa0For the price, I think the performance is justified.||Upgrade it 16gb for better performance.||I recommended to all please buy and check laptop performance.||Display is wonderful and the performance is mind blowing !||Good gaming performances,Simply Awesome for Gaming.||Battery performance is very poor normal useage it's comes around 70min,other features are good except battery life go for it
Not camera high quality Very low and performance cpu ram is good averageAnd very costly but it cheep quality
Value for money üíØPretty good features at a reasonable price with good looks and strong build quality.|_|price|:|If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt.......

I got this laptop for 62k, for that it has a good spec to price ratio.||I won't call it a bang for the buck but the price is pretty good.Pros-1) its has an 144hz display which is an eyecandy, and no other laptop offers such display in this price range.||This is also not present in any laptop in this price range.8)the my asus feature on this laptop is really convinient to wirelessly transfer files from phone to laptop.||SSD is very fast but my only complain is it is 512gb but can't complain its size for the price I got this beast for.||I would close my eyes and buy this laptop if your budget is 62k range.Note: Wait for Great Indian Sale guys
Laptop is good and perfect.....I thought at the laptop is screen ...Then I got replacement also but the reality..On battery power by default the laptop set to 60hz when ever you Plug in it changes from 60 to 144hz and when u plug out 144 to 60hz so this is why it 2 sec time screen gets off and on.....No issue in it....If you want to get rid it means right click on desktop and got display settings and goto advance system setting change 60 to 144hz then your laptop will 144hz during on battery power also then screen will not off...*Performance - 5/5*Display- 5/5*Battery- 4/5 on normal usage 3-4 hours  easily we are getting

using it for almost 20 days got ram upgraded to 16gb and added a 1TB HDD works smooth.Got it for 61990+3700(HDD)+4700(RAM)
I was just making a report on word and using google chrome simultaneously.||144hz display which is amazing in this price range2.||Use Libre Office instead.McAfee is a 1 year subscription.If you're reading this a few later, you should first compare the price of the 11th gen model.||\xa0Laptop is Good for gaming , and bootup speed is 10 s max , but screen bleeding in very high its even visible in morning and evening in dark scenes of videos ,i added images in review and the white yellow portion is increasing  ,so opted for replacement on 12 oct still no pickup has been done , getting replacement is not fast on amazon, waiting for replacement to be delivered.Update now after waiting 1 week they just cancelled replacement and opted for return , wtf is this disappointing customer service , i bought it at 56k ,now its at higher price and the customer service said wait for offers again and then buy it , why the hell would i buy it again if my replacement is cancelled without any explanation and they want me to wait for more , 0 star for amazon service ,
Received the product in record time, barely 17 hours in perfect packaging condition.||Buy this laptop, if you really just need an i5 over the current processor you have (I had an i3 7th Gen) and a dedicated graphics card (I didn‚Äôt have) over an equivalent 11th Gen as the prices are much lower now and performance gains are hardly around 10-20% more.||However, it is quite thick.Overall for the price this is more than expected.||I overall this is the best laptop I have ever seen in this price range.||Only hiccup I have is that it should have come with Office 365 free for a year as how it comes with other laptops which are less than its price range.||This is the best in this price range.||I would say overall the build quality is far better with this price range it has military grade tested acknowledgement, when it comes with performance its too supportive for high end software.||Probably the best laptop that you can get from Asus for this price range (Around 62k when I got it).||This kind of specs do come at a price though.||(1+2 years extended warranty + 1 year accidental damage protection from asus website for 3.3k not included in laptop's price)I suggest you to play paid games not pirated games to keep your laptop in best condition.I uninstalled pre installed antivirus.I trust windows defender.This laptop can run GTA V and watchdogs 2 like butter on ultra settings when pluged in (charging).||Got it under 62K best perfomance under this price range.||Amazing laptop for the price, if you want to go for a budget gaming laptop this should be your go to, upgradability is also very good with empty slots for easy upgrade of ram and ssd
Excellent performance in all respects.||\xa0Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source.||it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine.||Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....||*Currently using since past 7 days & I will post a detailed review in couple of months
I saw this laptop I'm offline store at 68kI got this at amazing priceGo for it upto 60kEvery thing is premium in this Laptop.||I bought this laptop at 62k price , RGB looks so good.||ASUS is bring TUF Laptops that are tough in all sense in a real economy price.||This is one of the best laptop under 62000 and I will definitely recommend you this under this price range.This laptop is Allrounder uses like:- gaming, editing, and display quality was also good according to price range.In this price range you cannot get better display quality but this the beast

Recieved in a perfect condition and am happy with the out of the box feeling.||You can customise almost all of the stuff.Also be sure to switch the display to HD quality as I got a freaking heartache when I saw the video quality
Awesome Product at this price range, super fast, Boot within 5 sec, Speakers are load enough, Full HD .. awesome clarity..pre install Windows 10, No MS office installed, have to installed by own, Backlit RGB keyboard is awesome
In the beginning I faced a problem, laptop screen used to get balnk white and I had to force shutdown it and restart.But now after updating graphics driver, it's working roperly without any issues.||Very good product and recommend at price of 62K.||Battery backup is good  for office use.No heating issues.Best in segment with no doubt bought this after lots of research ....

Very nice laptop.||This particular laptop at 62K is a bargain IPS display at 144hz is a gangster, blacks are awesome, Call of Duty Warzone is amazing, although RTX will be even better but you cannot expect RTX at this price, I don't think there is a better laptop than this in Amazon India right now with with i5 chip at this price either gaming or non-gaming.||This is the best gaming laptop at this price.||\xa0This is the best laptop with the price range i can say, for gaming its perfect with 144hz refresh rate can get max 120fps with lowest settings and with high arround 70-80fps which is actually very good.||\xa0For the price, I think the performance is justified.||only 4 core and start heating in 10 min when we play HTA5 worst product please dont buy the product
You can't say anything in Performance but ngl the  battery sucks you'll only get 1.5 hour battery backup no matter what you do, buy this only if you're going to use it while staying near power connection else you'll regret , but still we can't unsee the price rn, in this price after applying offers its about 53k so if you're getting this beast in 53k and have to compromise with battery I'd say go for it.||it is the best laptop at this price point...... don't think just go for it", "I bought it on the prime day .||Buyers and sellers kindly upload images of laptop front and laptop closed design like...closed laptop images.... opened laptop images
