battery|:|Anyway I got cheaper one (which got delivered from Bengaluru) post cancelling non-backlit one (which was initiated from Mumbai)I haven’t tested its full battery and performance with games, coding yet.||Screen is great, typing experience is wonderful, speakers are good too and the battery life is about 5.5 hours based upon normally web browsing, lot of typing and occasionally watching movies as well.||The finger print scanner works fine as well.I have only two complains about this product that is first is the battery backup in descrition it says upto 12 hrs but it only stays alive upto 4-5 hours please look into this and second is that you can't install graphics card and the video memory is of only 1gb VRAM so you can't edit vidoes smoothly or play some little bit 3D games 2D ames works fine.CONCLUSION:if you can sacrifice games then go for this laptop if you cna't then look for gaming laptop as in this price segment you can get some great gaming laptops and yeah you can't return and have refund for this product.||After update I faced yellow tint display issue, but I fix this issue from Lenovo Vantage app.You can do setting in Lenovo Vantage app to improve battery cycle life.Silent laptop there is no noise issue and heating issue.Made in India printed backside on laptop and Made in China printed on Charger.Finger Sensor is good in built in power button.Sound quality is clear but not loud.MS Office Home & Student gives you Word, Excel, PowerPoint, One note.||But no complaints here because dull screen was mentioned in so many reviews.Battery is good and battery management is very good.Overall design and keybord is excellent.After watching so many reviews,  I realized that Thinkpad is actually a very premium brand and its E series is cheaper one.Some tips for accessories: sleeve for E14 should be purchased of 13.3 size if it is Targus one.||But, though battery claim is it will last for 12-13 hours, it does not.||I bought it for 58k.I think it is a value for money if you want good built quality, good battery backup, fingerprint senser, and many features which prove that this suffices the needs of almost everyone.Even though it has i5, it still gets done most of the jobs without an issue, but you will definitely feel the difference with i7, like I did since had been using a lenovo i7 thinkpad before this.||* Good battery life, lasts a day,with full recharge and 8-10 hours usage.||I wanted to have a lightweight & long battery life laptop.||So no yellow, pink, blue shades, looking nice.Booting is so fast and battery backup is 6+hours with regular uses.||The battery is solid, it is fast, the keyboard is amazing.||Only challenge I see the battery life is about 4 to 5 hours but the claim was 12 hours.||Product sturdy battery life decent.||No overheating, no lags,.Battery life average 7-8 hrs, with a full battery charge.Super fast quick chargingConsBattery could have been better in a 60k laptop.||It is good for busy persons like me, quick log in and log off, good battery, light weight - so very easy to carry around and I use it very rough - much suitable laptop.||product is lightweight, good battery backup, superb display, fast, good camera, excellent keyboard (best in business),minor spark of light notifications is missing.Overall excellent.||Very nice battery perfect features by seeing the price....and latest technology...in given price it's the best one.||Offers battery life of atleast 10hours.||Happy with performance.Good battery backup.Will update more feedback later.||This is a good anti glare quality, sufficient battery life about 6-7 hours during continue work, weight of laptop not friendly.||Only 3 hours battery life.||Superb battery backup.||Decent battery life.||Fast, Rugged, Strong Lappy

I love thik paid laptops .||Then after 1 year there were battery issues and call reception issues.||My battery is not working anymore.|_|office|:|I have 15.6 inch office laptop and at times with single hand it feels large.3.||MS Office- it has MS office home and student edition which gets activated once linked to Microsoft account (Key detail is on Box as well).||Display- Not as good as MacBook but better than my office HP laptop.||I have done it multiple times at office while cable is pulled accidentally or water droplets are spilled while using sipper It can rotate 180 degree but it doesn’t have all angle view optimised, so its better to use at normal laptop angle .6 Cooling- it didn’t get hot.||But as it’s mostly for home and  limited office use, it is descent for that3.||N that too may be due to this single memory slot available with the laptop- office that has been offered as MS Office 2019, is not the complete one.||This laptop is best for sort a person who is looking for serious office work and doesn’t want to spend money on a laptop for at least 5-7 years.||It’s the whole nine yards!6) Noise: The laptop is extremely quiet.The Bad:1) Windows and Office: With a business laptop they should bundle a Win10 Pro and full feature office but all in all can’t complain.2) Speakers: I mean they are nice but nothing to write home about.||Free windows 10 and office 20193.||(For me its fine as I play games on mobile, and use video/photo editing once in a blue moon )After usage:- Boots up in less than 10 seconds or even faster- I did not hear fan sound, as I have not used CPU intensive apps.- Battery is definitely good, when compared to my office laptop- Sound by Harman, feels good.||I see this as bonus.I had initial difficulty setting up office license, as the pre-installed once is office-360, after reaching Microsoft support they have fixed this for me by installing other version of office.||Durable and easy to use.Only difficulty I faced was that the Ms office which is pre-installed was not working for me and it took a lot of hassle to call up customer care and ultimately it was resolved by Microsoft customer care.||They uninstalled and installed the right Ms office for me.||Trust me I have used it in my office too.||I was searching for a laptop that I can use for my office & personal use.||I am working in an IT firm & used many of business laptops.But thinkpad impressed me the most for it's durability & quality.I was searching a good laptop for office uses andafter reviewd a lot i choose thinkpad E14 over dell inspiron .Below are some highlights i experienced over a week.Pros-Good displayNice keyboardBest processerFast chargingCons-Sound quality is not that great.No bags provided with box
I love it!||Ppt and others dont open instantly keep prompting to install MS office and Office 360.||Finally it is installed but still has issue with Word, Ppt and Excel and keeps asking to install MS office
The laptop is great, for academic purpose though.||Only sour point is , MS office cannot be enabled even though the account was there
Best configuration in this price.||Unable to activate office 365.||Product key for office is not present.||Good product
Dear allMicrosoft key not included  so not good product amazon link so includes office home and &student  microsoft  includes but not key in this box
I have bought ThinkPad.||Amazing Laptop as I was expecting.Smart professional look.Fast performance.Light weight.All are good.Worth buy
Nice product , worth to buy
Nice productEverything working fineOne star deducted due to problem in activation of ms office
Worst thing I had ever buy and very much disappointed from Amazon
It is so good with windows and office with such configuration same can check with Dell also.||When I tried to activate microsoft office home in my system it is asking buy options .||Installation of ms office was hassle free.||As it comes with windows and student office.||With this product give ms office 2019 without product key.||Good

After using for 4 days...facing display issueThe seller is selling defective laptops with discount.I have raised request to return the product, I will keep posted on the further statusI kindly request not to purchase this product
Display is really average, returned one unit because of faulty trackpadGot second replacement, this one had yellow ugly tint on display ..Already an average display with yellowish tint made the experience bad.||Have requested for refund now.Whule buying it's about luck as to whether you get normal whites or yellowish tint display
Really nice product...Go for it.. 👍🏻

Keyboard is not working after 10 months of use.||The display is worst in this price range.||Brought this product in August, its really a great product but one thing was totally unacceptable which is display.||It has got TN display which has poor viewing angles and poor color reproduction other wise excellent product and it also has WIFI 6.||Damaged
very slow and display not working properly.|_|screen|:|14inch- I prefer 14inch screen as it’s appropriate unless u play games.||Next I poweron the laptop and saw screen was flickering and suddenly  laptop went DEAD.!!!||There was no screen  display  just some light in power button and escape key.||Core i5 10th Gen fast processor variant and not the other variants of the 10th Gen i5 those are good but this one is the best, with 128 GB SSD (hopefully PCle NVMe M.2- need to check this) plus 1 TB HHD with FHD display n viewing angles are better n more than the other laptops in this price range where the screen is anti glare as well- Colors are accurate n I believe it's all how the RGB range is set for this FHD screen.||Will weigh it on a scale n confirm backNow coming to its few negative traits:- it does not have a full metal body but thin metal just on the screen flap which looks like a metallic spray paint done on the plastics.||But when i went through the reviews, some reviews were really bad mostly regarding screen.||When I received the product, to my delight, the screen was good (no yellowish light issue) and then I went through every aspect of this product carefully.||It should also be mentioned that they are tuned by Herman.3) Screen: The screen is an anti-glare Led lit LCD.||This screen is above average.The Ugly:1) Camera: This camera is straight up bad....||Big and bulky (screen could have smaller Basel)2.||now the entire screen is flickering (I was using it in the dark mode, so it was clearly visible).||@Amazon pls change the product, received defective product.NO HELP FROM LENEVO PLEASE HELP TO REPLACE AS NOONE SUPPORTING FROM LENEVO
The screen is defective.||there is yellow tint and the screen colour looks warm always.||Its not like you boot up to a un-lock/login screen and then you have to place finger.- Obviously the keyboard and the BackLight.- Military grade body, I am sure its robust then its peers.- In-built webcam.- Type-C USB charging port & you can use it for connecting USB devices.||I purchased this laptop because of its light weight and good ergonomically designed keyboard.Coming from Dell studio 15.6 inch laptop, screen is noticeably duller but viewing angles are good.||But no complaints here because dull screen was mentioned in so many reviews.Battery is good and battery management is very good.Overall design and keybord is excellent.After watching so many reviews,  I realized that Thinkpad is actually a very premium brand and its E series is cheaper one.Some tips for accessories: sleeve for E14 should be purchased of 13.3 size if it is Targus one.||Screenguard application is difficult and makes screen more dull.I purchased it in 57240 in prime day sale.||45 minutes and you’re good to go for 5 hours.Built quality is obviously great because of thinkpad brand.Touch sensor is fast, keyboard is awesome and screen is okayish.Light weight but not the lightest.It has a manual cover for camera, so good for those who require this feature.Sound is crisp, clear but not loud.Its look screams that it only means buisness.So overall a good balanced product for 60k.||I purchased this product in August and within 45 days dead pixels started appearing on the screen.||Screen colors get change if two people watching screen were not in single plane.3.||Joints between the screen and outer plastics layer got disoriented which may lead to damage
