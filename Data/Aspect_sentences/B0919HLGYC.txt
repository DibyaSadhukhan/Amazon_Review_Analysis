time|:|First of all the product was not up to the mark as its boot time is very high and every single operation is taking too much time.Then the price fluctuation is there as I bought this laptop on 27.08.2021 at the price of 44,590 without any accessories but now they are giving this laptop at 43,990 with briefcase.||Never expected this from Amazon
I purchased dell laptop last month from Amazon.In month only started facing charging & lot of heating issues in it , tried calling multiple times to Dell customer care toll free number given by Amazon CSA but no response from that number.Now I am helpless don't know what to do & suggest not to buy atleast branded laptop from online.||Very worst service by Amazon .please never buy any product from amazon
I bought it as itâ€™s compatible for Windows 11 but disappointed as it is very slow and lots of time just freezes for no reason at all the USB ports are a bit undersized as you have to apply pressure to get an external drive and/or pen drive to be connected
Worst product ever.||Now it has heat issue, screen got haged for multiple times after purchasing, and screen got blanked.||Track ball pad is not working sometimesnew System is too slowclick keyboard take lots time to type on consoleoverall performance is badafter some time i called DELL CS they are saying nothing we can do.i would not suggets anyone to buy
