I liked this product very nice laptop in budget.|_|price|:|Go for it
They only have used products please don't buy from lenovo", "I have received a used product for first time and then it got replaced with much older product than that so please don't buy products from lenovo unless you want to use someone used product
Well, I had to replace my 6 yr old Mac book and since mac books were out of budget, had to look at windows.Was not keen to purchase a 15 inch as I wanted a compact laptop but no company was offering the same specs as these in a 60-70k price range in 13 inch category.The deal on Lenovo was excellent and I purchased it.||The laptop is fair for the price it come at.||Buy it for 52000 in offers, don't buy for 60K or more", "I purchased it in offer for 52K directly without any Card offer, for that price, without any doubt this is the best laptop, you can't find these specs at this price, specially i5 10th gen with 120 Hz Refresh Rate and the keyboard is of excellent quality with 4 GB GRAPHICS.Cons are average quality front camera but you have privacy shutter, and Battery is not bad, but for normal work, it can give you around 6 Hours, but in business laptop, you can get around 10 hours for using word n ppt etc.||Overall performance is good with this price range.||\xa0Bought@58k Good for now , Gaming And browser use

The is laptop is absolutely the worst with very weak processor .||I bought it in haste and didn't think clearly while purchasing it.||It's a train wreck cannot handle heavy tasks and gaming etc.||It has a clear thermal management issue and thermal throttle all the time.||It simply reaches 99Â°C for simple gaming for five minutes.||That's it its a disaster purchase go for ryzen any gen but not intel.||These chips cannot even beat the ryzen 2-3 rd gen chips in any possible grounds
I recently bought the product, and the display was too bad.||I already have another Lenovo laptop, but the new one which I bought has a yellowish display.||Did the nightlight OFF, colour management, and several other fixes.||Can anyone help on this regard, please
