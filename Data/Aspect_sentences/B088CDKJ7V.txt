Solid specs at this price.||I've been using this product for 11 months now and there are some pros and cons about this product.Pros: latest design, minimalist looks, thin bezels (not bezel less), good picture quality, AMD processor is boom, Enough  RAM to make it future proof.Cons: Speakers are trash (get a Bluetooth speaker for this one), Battery life is shit (I had to charge it 3-4 times during my 8hr shift of google meet and that too on battery saver and lowest brightness settings).Overall: The RAM, processor and SSD makes it a fast processing machine but at this price point, one can get way better options and if you're not about looks then buying a 2nd hand laptop would be a miles better deal, you can even get a more powerful processing unit if you search thoroughly and wisely in 2nd hand market.||So cooling system could have been better.❌ No backlit keyboard is a crime in this generation❌ No c type port avaliableI upgraded ram to 20GB and i can play games like valorant and counter strike smoothly  and also do video and photo editing.Overall nice laptop in this range but you might face heating issue most of the time and NO BACKLIT keyboard will hurt you while using it during night or low light area..
Configuration (Ryzen5+Vega Graphics +8gb ram + 516 SSD)  is too good  ;But Laptop's Speakers Quality is too bad almost dead , and they are supplying 3rd party accessories ( LGC Battery & Delta Adapter ) .Built quality (plastic body parts and keyboard) is not good , Go for Dell or HP if you are a Student .You cannot claim from ACER If anything happpens to your laptop , they blame customer only .||GTA 5 gives upto 30fps on high graphics setting .But , while gaming the battery 🔋  lasts only for 1 to 2 hrs while full charged .Else , while doing normal work , I lasts for 4 to 5 hrs .It also runs Android studio( which is heavy software )  smoothly without consuming more battery .Camera quality is not good .I suggest not to install chrome browser , instead use edge browser which is pre installed , as chrome consumes more ram and battery .||Don't fool us amazon
