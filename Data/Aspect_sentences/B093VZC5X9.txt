It is very frustrating to order from amazon, This is 3rd time I am receiving damaged order, It seems no quality check on the amazon side, Last time I booked a soundbar and it was a broken piece, this time I ordered a Laptop and touchpad is not working, Now there is no replacement available for this laptop, It will go for return after 5-6 days and then the amount will refund after 10 days something, This is not only blocking my money it is also disturbing my plan, Now I can't order another piece until my refund not processed as I had paid from amazon pay wallet.||This is my first laptop, and am very much satisfied with it.Display quality, build quality, light weight.... GREATüëåüèºI was finding it difficult to find a display with IPS + Anti-glare at this price range.||MS Teams loads quickly.Sound quality is good.||- Build quality is bad.||Cheapest quality plastic used, laptop flexes, makes creaking sound every where.- Trackpad is weird, feels like broken but works well- Glossy screen but I knew this before buying+ Fast, boots to desktop in 6 seconds (remove mcafee, bloatware), great battery life, beautiful FHD screen, light weight, nice speakers.||Other than build, everything else feels great.If build quality is a major concern stay away.||Sound quality is acceptable but not loud enough.||bought this laptop last week, I'm very satisfied with its performance and built quality.||the sound quality is ok, not extraordinary, comes with 720p decent webcam, which is enough for your online meetings and all.||Speaker quality - decentDisliked:1.||Comes with licensed win10 and as soon as u bootup asks for win11 upgrade.There are few things which I genuinely feel hp could have done better and that is keyboard quality (this one resembles just like ProBook but ProBook has much better quality...but again the ProBook screen is bad while this one's screen is good)Given the price range the overall feel n performance and the brand support u can expect down the lane is worth a deal(quality compromise on plastics used which I agree but it's not that bad and definitely not for gamers ).||Good configuration, performs well overall.Build quality needs to be better, screen brightness may be low for outdoor use.Warranty was pre-dated by about 3 weeks when I bought it and was a hassle to solve with HP and Amazon combined.||Laptop stopped working after appx 15days,  Seems faulty product has been delivered or quality is such like that it only will work until the period you can request replacement.||Now I have to keep chasing HP Service Center to get this repaired
I bought this laptop for my sister for studying purpose and this laptop does a good job.PROS:1) Screen comes with an ips display and colours are accurate, best for media consumption.2) Battery backup is good enough, upto 7-8 hours.3) Lightweight and easy to carry, 1.42kgs.4) Comes with pre-installed windows 10 home and ms office student version.5) Boot time is very fast, within 5 seconds.6) Average quality camera, good for video calling.7) Sound quality is good but not that loud.8) ram speed is 3200 which is quite decent.CONS:1) No gaming but what can you expect under this price range.Those were the only cons I found till now, if your budget is around 40k then go for it, you can even checkout realmebook which is around 37k with card offers in GIF sale, with card offers hp costs around 36k in GIF, hope this helps, have a great day.||SSD makes a big difference in speed.HD Web camera, good sound quality - great for online classes.||Performance is good, quick booting, good screen quality,Camera quality - ok, not good not bad.But battery usage duration is poor compared to claimed 9.15 hours.||\xa0Features are good but quality is very cheap and fittings are also uneven and loose.||beeter to spens 5k more for quality or go for cheap laptop atleast you get value for money.Features wise 4 star but quality wise 2 star

It's ok. Its took few minutes for initialization.||I have received my product today, product seems to be fine so far, only issue is it‚Äôs showing 11 months warranty , where it should be 12 months.||Sadly nothing helps even if the product is new and is in warranty.||When I check HP warranty it shows starts with 31st May 2021 to 30th May 2022- remaining 11 months ( kindly HP team & Apprio Seller can look at this subject).8.||Though this is too early to comment, but the first look and usage experience is perfect.One thing that I noticed, I purchased the Laptop on 13th September, but the warranty has been started from 21st August.. How is that possible?||Laptop is good for people who uses for doccument editing,browsing,online classes/meetings,video watchingMay not be that good for people uses extensively for gaming , running long scripts,for better storageSolution of warranty issue:I saw many people rising issue on warranty, i can share my experience.you can use HP support assisstant-->chat with expert-->they will asking share you docs of invoice with serial number of laptop, and laptop back side image, which can be shared to HP people, they would update the warranty from date of purchase
I got this product yesterday.. when I checked the warranty it‚Äôs already started from May 31 ,2021 and 10months warranty lefts .what‚Äôs this mean?||Its normal 5 to 6 hours.I only wish if touch pad were little extended as there is enough spaces to extend.As seen in others reviews there's warranty problem which can be fixed only by contacting HP Support Assistant.||(warranty period start 1 month earlier from the day you activate the Windows which can be solved as mentioned).||I ordered the Laptop on 6th Oct 2021, warranty information displayed on the Laptop however indicates warranty expires on 11th Aug 2022.||Fan is making lot of noise.Received product today 9.9.2021 and when checked warranty information, it says started on 11th 08 2022
Good for a person who has to receive and send personal emails, chat on Skype and surf the internet.||While my experience with the laptop has been good and no issues noticed in terms of performance or battery at this price.The only thing i regret is buying it online on Amazon as the warranty received is only for 9 months.||When you check the warranty on the date of delivery which was just next day of placing the order, the warranty shows as 9 months.My advice is to avoid buying it on Amazon.||Eventually, the warranty date resolved itself without need for intervention.||They only charge you for the warranty but they wouldn't respond to the issues.||Worst product and never buy any product from amazon ., all are fake product today i purchased new product and seeing warranty already 3 months over and mcAfee exired and bundled MS office not working.||It hardly lasts for 4.5 hours in power saving mode.Updating the warranty period after buying this product is still a challenge even after 5 days.||Product is nice, you can buy it.Only concern is product warranty, I got laptop on 26th July 2021 and confirmed product warranty from HP they informed me, warranty start date is 19 May 2021.||As per them 2 months product warranty already elapsed.I request to seller, please please consider this point.||I recieved this laptop yesterday then why warranty is showing only 10 months.||Problem is with warranty.||\xa0Amazon sell not good productWhy my laptop warranty start 2 month before?||Every thing is good As such....Hopping for the best run
