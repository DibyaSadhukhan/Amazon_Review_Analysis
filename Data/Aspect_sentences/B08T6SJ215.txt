quality|:|it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.Sound output is not that great.....so far so good.||Looks premium, built quality is also good and also fast.||Sound quality is the another killer.||Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition
Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated.||Looks good 🙂😊
Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank.||Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site.||Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality.||Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.Not tried yet for heavy games like PUBG, CS, ASPHALT etc..
Never ever go for this product.||For name sake they have said 8GB, but the time it takes to refresh n open n response its lagging... Those 4 stars is only for look n packing n build quality.||Likes:1) Display2) Looks3) Brand value and reliability and number of service centersDislikes:1) Poor battery quality (2hrs for charging and 1.5 hrs for discharging2) Slow processor (it takes 5-10 mins to start, however after it gets started, overall performance is OK for this price, not fast as i3, not laggy as Celerion or Athlon
I had Dell Vostro from past 8yrs.||Seriously my old laptop was performing better than this.screen quality is good and lightweight as well.||Display and build quality is good for the price.||It is slow as they saidNot impressed - is slow for 8 GB this is when I don't even use heavy duty apps (not even teams, skype etc); battery drains fast; started giving trouble after a month- not switching on- shouldn't need repairs this early
Nice and met my expectations
I am writing this review after 3 months of use -Build quality and screen is quite good..Not recommended for heavey users as screen freezes sometimes due to unknown reasons.Sound quality is acceptableBattery backup is better than I expected and it also charge very fast...Overall it's an average product...alternate for this laptop I would recommend SSD laptops which are much faster...||I buy this laptop for my studies but this also working as superbly for gaming and there's screen quality also good and works with the good speed I bought this in offer price 36,500 and there is best buy and value for money

Totally in awe of this laptop .It’s a wonderful deal for the price.||Received defective product initially.Battery was not changing.But replaced immediately next day by Amazon.Will review again after checking the performance after a week.||Value for money...but the laptop performance is slow sometimes......U can go for it!!|_|screen|:|The screen keeps freezing.||Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality.||Often the screen turns to black screen and only cursor will move unable to see any application in the background.||Seriously my old laptop was performing better than this.screen quality is good and lightweight as well.||It is slow as they saidNot impressed - is slow for 8 GB this is when I don't even use heavy duty apps (not even teams, skype etc); battery drains fast; started giving trouble after a month- not switching on- shouldn't need repairs this early
Nice and met my expectations
I am writing this review after 3 months of use -Build quality and screen is quite good..Not recommended for heavey users as screen freezes sometimes due to unknown reasons.Sound quality is acceptableBattery backup is better than I expected and it also charge very fast...Overall it's an average product...alternate for this laptop I would recommend SSD laptops which are much faster...||A clear no to this product
Worth for money, slim, less heating, fast booting, anti glare screen, Go for it.||I buy this laptop for my studies but this also working as superbly for gaming and there's screen quality also good and works with the good speed I bought this in offer price 36,500 and there is best buy and value for money
Frequently the system is getting stuck while using Teams
Pros:1.MS office is available after signing in2.Quick start in less than 10s3.Aesthetics4.8GB RAM and Ryzen 3 processor under 35K5.Good sound qualityCons:1.Keyboard back light is not available2.Screen brightness is quite low

amazon delivery boy delivered without cover.i bought with nice expectations , but lot of mental disappointment as amazon delivery without amazon cover, and also HP laptop not good , each time shutdown and restart for 10 min
I took this laptop for zoom meetings but this does not support backgroundI had to buy additional green screen whereas other laptop support background without green screenSo it is no value for money compared to other brands
The processor is very slow.||If u want laptop which lags right from lock screen take this.||I like the light touch and screen navigation by my fingers
Good product

Not worthy
Good laptop for students.||Screen quality is good.good for handling.fast and secure
Resolution of screen is goodSorry be quality is goodBooting takes long time
Purchased for online class.||The screen calibration is upto the mark.||Enough battery backup with speed charging , impressive screen experience, keyboard setup is adequately expensed.||No
Worst performace and lagging a lot, why the hell the screen is not standard, it is very delicate.Not satisfied.|_|
