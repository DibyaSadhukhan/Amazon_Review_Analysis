One of the worst product.|_|screen|:|Little bit slow and nice one
The laptop is strictly for office/student use.Gaming capabilities are less, battery life is adequate, 15\'6" screen makes videos and movie lover\'s life easy.For the above purposes, I would rate 4/5, I\'ve rated lesser since it doesn\'t cater my performance requirements
Battery life only 1 hours
Like key board is good  camera is goodDislike power button not on the proper place
This item is only looks good and attractive but it is the all time slowest laptop I've ever seen.If you contact dell then they would ask ypu to purchase SSD or RAM
Its a best laptop than 3593 as it has LED display and brighter screen.|_|life|:|Little bit slow and nice one
