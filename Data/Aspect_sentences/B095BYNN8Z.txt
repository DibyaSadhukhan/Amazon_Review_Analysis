The biggest let down is the display.It is good only from the exact front.Shows negative image with distorted colours from the side view.Disappointing when you pay â‚¹25,904.The charger looks like toy.Windows 10 booting takes lots of time even without any bloat ware.The charger socket looks very delicate.And Amazon delivery was on time.Tracking the parcel is very inconsistant.Recently Amazon interface leaves much to be desired.I have seen better Amazon days.||Nice laptop and it is little bit slow
My biggest mistake of buying this laptop, it screen get freezes when running Microsoft teams and Zoom in it..i called the acer support and they said they do not support these appsâ€¦now if the small apps will not work in this laptop then what is the use of this laptop..my money is wasted..I bought this for my son for his school classes now I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s to do..Amazon is also not helping at all..donâ€™t know where to go..
Really good laptop.||Value for money.||on first impressions it is a value for money, work well without any lag, slim and sturdy, does not have MS Office, screen resolution is nice, keyboard typing is easy
It works OK it's a bit slow can be made faster by disabling few unnecessary background process.||Its laggy, its display is worse, not value for money.||Simply waste
West of the money.||This laptop open with ultimaker cura 4.10 software easily
