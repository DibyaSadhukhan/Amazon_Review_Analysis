Average build quality.||Noticceable flex at the palm rest.Cheap plastic for keys, the good keyboard layout picked from their ThinkPad but they could not emulate the quality of the keys.MS OFFICE is not available, it's only installed, you still need to purchase it.The biggest TURN OFF is the HUGE BEZELS, the bottom one is 6-7 times that of side bezel, its bigger than the bezels on my TV, it's as big as those on CRT monitors.Audio quality is very average even when they claim Dolby certified.||The quality is a 3 star.The laptop weighs 2.5kg approx which is somewhat okay for this price.||I currently have the and ryzen 3 version of this laptop.Pros:Slim designOkay for students and senior citizensGood screen qualityFast charging, could charge completely in 1.5 hr or less.Heat management is okayCons:Low battery life, it dies in 3 hrs if used for watching a movie or multitasking.Somewhat heavy, but okay.Camera quality is pathetic, use good light in order to get a more clear picture.Boot up takes time, 30-45 seconds.Lags too much if shortcuts such as tapping with three or four fingers on the trackpad.After opening this laptop, first set up the latest Microsoft Office version.If needed, pay for the antivirus or remove it.||Not bad
It looks like an old laptop, the keyboard is horrible the camera resolution is so badWaste of time and money but I got my refund back and I’m so glad for that
Battery draining very fast and  slow to start and not support minor graphics games and not so advance features and also its camera quality is very worst...

Overall a good buy...camera is of low resolution..||However the camera picture is not that great.||Soeakers are not good and camera quality slso poor.||bottom firing speakers with flexible plastic around it sounds bad, would do for video calls, but the front camera is disappointing.Very disappointing in its price range (50,000 when I bought)But it is lightweight, boots up to desktop in 15seconds, and the anti-glare screen works good for reading and working.||Not bad
