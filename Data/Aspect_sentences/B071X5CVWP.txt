price|:|I'm a big fan of Latitude series, based on that I tried to buy even a renewed latitude laptop but the seller sent a nearly 7 year old machine (verified with the Dell service tag) at a huge price of 30K.||good product, good to use, good speed, must buy
Nice  laptop having good battery cheap price and good processor
good laptop against it's value
I bought this as a school laptop for my son.||Actually, the specs mean it's better than almost every other device at twice the price retail in Australia.||Can't fault this laptop - should have bought two at the price.||At this price point you can't go wrong.||The 4th gen i5 CPU, although less efficient than new ones is still faster than the CPUs in many of the similarly priced new economy laptops (Pentium N).I purchased two reconditioned laptops from this seller and had two totally different experiences.||For the price, it was a great deal.||That means they\'re low voltage, which saves the battery, but a tad slower having only 2 physical cores "double-pumped" to 4 threads.If you need a good business-class laptop at a reasonable price, this is the one for you.||The price is good for my use.||Fair price, functions properly
Works and looks like brand new.||The price is more than fair.||Muy buena máquina
This is an excellent laptop for the price!||Cant beat the price, a business laptop at student prices!|_|battery|:|good product, good to use, good speed, must buy

I bought this as a school laptop for my son.||I can't believe it, a so-called refurbished device with a battery that goes ALL DAY.||On the odd day where he's been using a bit more battery than usual, he uses Windows 10's built in eco mode, which gives the lappy some legs (Oh, and it shipped with Windows 10 ready to go).||The battery performs like new and holds a charge for a very long time.||The other laptop went back.Unlike the other, which had a dead battery and nonfunctional keyboard, this one looks and works like new, battery included.||That means they\'re low voltage, which saves the battery, but a tad slower having only 2 physical cores "double-pumped" to 4 threads.If you need a good business-class laptop at a reasonable price, this is the one for you.||The battery life is pretty awesome, and the keyboard layout is great and the model I received does have a keyboard back light (which is not a feature I realized I enjoy so much, so that was a nice bonus).||Not to mention it has bad battery life.||This laptop is better for a kid than an adult
I liked ease of use,performance was fast,very nice laptop for the money,the only reason for not 5 stars on everything was ask if lightweight to me fine ,but I can see if people are already used to some of the other laptops out there this would seem not so lightweight, and for the battery lif I really didn’t have time to test, it was destroyed by wildfire here in paradise ca
I bought this lap top primarily to play backup music on gigs.||I always plug it in when I use it so I don't worry about the battery.||Just waiting on a new laptop battery and this will be the best value buy I've ever made
Excellent item for my needs and for the money.|_|computer|:|This wasn't a big problem for me to get through, but I am handy with computers.For the computer itself, it is amazing.||A new computer with the same type of processor is much faster, sometimes I get good fps but most of the times the fps is very low and I have to enable special settings with graphics in game to atleast get decent fps , second, it has tortured me many with problems like after closing the laptop then opening it again the screen is black, it has also failed opening many programs like minecraft  java or Filmora X.||Finally, when connected to a monitor or without connected to one it always fails at loading videos at 1080p on Youtube, this computer doesn't even let you watch a video in 1080p and will buffer frequently to reduce the quality to something like 360p.||This computer meets all the requirements to work quickly.||I needed a solid work laptop computer for cheap.||It’s been years since I had a computer and I needed some initial help.||The computer works well.||wifi doesn't work", 'Stay away from this computer if you need the internet.||Common problem with windows 10 but unable to fix on this computer.||My unit arrived with a warped keyboard and a dead pixel on the computer screen.|_|key|:|One sheet of paper to tell you where to find the Win10 activation key and a 2nd piece of paper to tell you to make USB emergency Windows boot key.||EDIT: I just realized the laptop I received does NOT have the mouse/toggle between the B-G-H keys.||The other laptop went back.Unlike the other, which had a dead battery and nonfunctional keyboard, this one looks and works like new, battery included.||It never asked for the Microsoft product key during setup, but after windows loaded a few times it finally stated it did not have an active product key.||My laptop arrived in near perfect condition; there's a tiny crack on the bottom left corner of the keyboard, but it's just cosmetic and hasn't caused any issues while in use.||The battery life is pretty awesome, and the keyboard layout is great and the model I received does have a keyboard back light (which is not a feature I realized I enjoy so much, so that was a nice bonus).||I really think it is an older model because the keyboard area is covered in black contact paper.It does get online prety well but I can't study in a public place because I can't use the headphones.||The seller should've place the key on the back of tje laptop", "I don't like that the dealer misrepresented the product.||* Dealer didn't supply key for Windows 10  Pro and I had to purchase a new key  from windows.||I tried to contact dealer  no call back before purchasing the key  to operate the laptop.||Screen has dead spots in the back light, very noticeable problem.Windows 10 Product Key had the silver scratched off already, exposing the full key, yet Windows was not activated.||My unit arrived with a warped keyboard and a dead pixel on the computer screen.|_|windows|:|It never asked for the Microsoft product key during setup, but after windows loaded a few times it finally stated it did not have an active product key.||* Dealer didn't supply key for Windows 10  Pro and I had to purchase a new key  from windows.||Common problem with windows 10 but unable to fix on this computer.|_|
