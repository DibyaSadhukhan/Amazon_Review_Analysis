Purchased this product from offline at â‚¹61000.The laptop's build quality is excellent with average quality camera and battery backup is also good, it lasts for 6-7 hours on normal use but if you're a heavy user it may last maximum of 2-3 hours.The performance of this laptop is nice and will be superb if one installs Ubuntu 20.04.Only things I didn't like is that it takes time to boot up (from 4.9-15.0 seconds, my old laptop is much better in this), heating issues are present on both operating systems.Speakers don't work in Ubuntu 20.04 and neither dell has provided the drivers and support for the same, but it supports Bluetooth headphones and wired ones on Ubuntu os.||After 3 months the battery  backup will be there only for 1.30 hrs.||I disabled bitlocker and now device has its speed.Apart from all this cons it is very decent device, if you are not very concerned about battery, this is best.||It has one of the best hardware combination you will get in 70K or even more.I want to reduce 0.5 star for battery only otherwise it is a 5 star device and I given also.|_|backup|:|& Battery backup is worst.||Battery backup less then 1 hour.||so that you may get better battery backup also.Finally i can say its best buy, rich look, sounds good, performance good, display is good, Cam is ok as expected and as required.regarding price, during duserra this price is 62,XXX/- with offers you can get for 60k.||Battery backup is good.||Battery backup not good.. battery life only 2hours

Being in this price range the product is nice and reliable but things could be done to make things a little better.||Worst batter backup.||After 3 months the battery  backup will be there only for 1.30 hrs.||No glitch in os and McAfee and ms office works quite well registration was easy.Cons:1.Battery backup is really a concern, max 3 hours, and it is new device, what will happen after 2 years can't imagine.|_|display|:|That has some display issue.||Dont know whey they discuss on narow bezzle, laptops not eating display size from years ago.Dont think with dell will get omlet with that heat.||so that you may get better battery backup also.Finally i can say its best buy, rich look, sounds good, performance good, display is good, Cam is ok as expected and as required.regarding price, during duserra this price is 62,XXX/- with offers you can get for 60k.||It's a non touch screen display.||But if you want crispier display go for this IPS laptop from HP, its far more recent/latest but a bit costlier ,hereamazon.in/gp/product/B08XNYN5QV  Although on sale days, they sell for the same price.Pros:1.|_|issue|:|This laptop has heating issues.||Like within 10 minutes it's regrading by 15 to 20%

AMAZON IS SELLING DEFECTIVE ITEMS.At the offer time I bought Dell Vostro 3400 14" laptop.||That has some display issue.||There was free Windows 11 upgrade option, During the upgradation time I received Blue screen due to some memory issue.NEED TO RETHINK ABOUT THE QUALITY OF PRODUCT AMAZON IS SELLING.||At first the laptop had freezing issue, either during booting or after lock screen it used to freeze 6/10 times.||Added another 8gb ddr4 ram to top it off.For me these changes worked, if someone is facing the same issues, then can try these steps.||Excellent laptop.... looking very classy look
