battery|:|Superb battery life.||All ok but heating problem is there and it's not 4.2 GHz it's only 2.4 GHz amazon doing  people fools wifi is dis connecting after minute to minute
Donâ€™t have Rj-45 port, 1 USB port missing,  heating issue, poor battery backup
So it took nearly 3-4 hours to charge it completely and charge remains for a Max of 2 hrs.... WiFi was not working and was getting disconnected after every couple of mins... KeyPad heating issue...||I guess if they can fix battery issue, it would be a killer...||It has good battery life and gets fully charged within an hour.||Bought during sale so got it under 60k.Long-term use for offices, classes and games.Screen,camera and sound are good.2 hrs-charging time5hrs-running time
Good product, boot time is around 10-15 seconds only, working smoothly.... battery backup is just around 4 to 5hrs not more than that
As expected
Overall Good
