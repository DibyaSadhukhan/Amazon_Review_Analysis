battery|:|Everything is good except the battery life.||If you are working with the videos, the battery drains very quickly and the life reduces to hardly 2- 2.5 hours.||but it comes without back lit keyboard, and one month trail antivirus , battery back up is 2:00 to 2:30 hrs only.||Battery drains too fast, battery power not really good.2.||It's a good laptop for daily usage...very fast and nice to handle...but battery draining fastly...I was played some games also.. good response.... overall it's a good laptop for this price..||- Sleek and Slim

Overall good laptop,works very speed,looks high quality,provided m2 slot can add internal harddisk,but battery is poor.Rest everything is fine.|_|quality|:|Good build quality.5.||for typing, relatively speaking, though not quite as pleasant as it is w a MacBookPro).Like the way the touchpad has been positioned slightly to the left.Also like the fingerprint sensor doubling up as the power on/off button.Front-facing cam quality also relatively good, along with wide coverage of (user) background.Would have preferred more RAM along with the whole pkg.Would have preferred more SSD storage space for this budget.Budget-wise, feel this is priced up by about 20%, and I think that it will sell more units if Lenovo brings it down accordingly.Overall, defn a good buy, and I'd recommend it for anyone who wants this config of laptop for their business/home purposes.||Great quality laptop.||Great Finish and built quality.||So thumps up to Lenovo.Pros:1)The build of laptop is excellent with premium built quality.||Fingerprint is pretty good at its job.5) Display quality is very good at this price range.||This is best latop for practical use
