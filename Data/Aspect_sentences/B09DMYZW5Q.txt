battery|:|If you want photo editing and video editing you need to install an external screen ( it has usb-c video port)Battery: 9/10 I get it why people has so much complaint about battery backup.||Yes it gives 1.5 hours of backup but you can increase it to 5+ hours (last night I did heavy coding and browsing for 4.5 hours with 30% battery left).||The trick is toi) enable hybrid mode.ii) while in battery backup press fn+q to make it in silent mode so that the fan speed reduces and uses less power.iii) reduce screen brightness by 2 pointsiv) switch off bluetooth if not usingThis should be enough to give 5 hours of backup easily.Asthetic: (5/10) the only thing I hate more than the screne is the body work of laptop.||It does catch the hand marks but you can clear them off easily5) I saw several reviews complaining of the battery but if you turn on the balanced mode(which is sufficient for my office work) then it easily gives 4-5 hours of backup.||Initially I had battery issue where battery was draining in 2 hours.||But with some online help from Lenovo support team and some surfing on net, now it's giving battery life of 4-6 hours.||This was the beast I have ever seen in my life, the laptop working really well, according to me only two drawbacks one is regarding battery draining and another one is such a negligible one that is not contains RGB keyboard just white back Light.||There is no lag at all while you are playing the NFS Run GTA V. But the battery life disappointed me as It will stay awake for some 2 hours even though the laptop is idle.||Battery life  four hourPerformance goodCamera Not up to the mark
The battery isn't up to the mark .I got it today on 20 September and after full charge it didn't wven last 100 minutes .||Rest all is awesome
Overall performance of the laptop is really good but the only disadvantage is the battery life.||The battery life is around 2 to 2 1/2 hrs.||Since it has a 120hz display the battery drains quickly.||Everything is perfect except the battery back up.||Doesn't last for more than 80-90 mins on battery.||With hybrid mode battery will last 4.5 to 5 hrs.||No issues found yet including battery backup.||Only issue is battery backup.||Happy with this product
It was delivered the next dayGraphics processor is good and delivers crisp imagesLiked the Legion and is working good for us
Overall performance is very good and it has a great design but battery backup is max 4-4.5 hrs.||Everything else fine.But battery life is worst.||Awesome gaming laptop battery only worst draining day
