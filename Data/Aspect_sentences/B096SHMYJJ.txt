Overall laptop is good except the screen.||I have been using this laptop for 6 months now.Pros:Good performanceLong battery lifeCons:Cheap build qualityFragileThe hinge just came off without any physical damage.||Good

Battery is running out fastly.||Worst laptopWorst customer service even after purchasing Premium Customer Care service from LenovoDon't buy Lenovo products
Nice product from Lenovo reviewing after 1 month of use goor product in this range...and battery life also more than 5hrs easily..
Good laptop for home use
Defective product.||The battery life is good and value for money.||üëç
U cannot game with it as its fps is very low after 50% of battery
value for money.||I can say display is very bad apart from display everything is awesome battery backup is 6-7 hours easily.||Overall amazing laptop...battery backup with light usage is around 10hours...and with YouTube and surfing - 6 to 7 hours....This is not gaming machine but still u can play fortnite @ low settings and get 100 to 150FPS ...BUT again it's not gaming machine...very handy laptop with slim design and portable charging option (Type c 65watt)
Best device i have got in years, battery backup easily 7-8 hrs of sot,nvidia graphics card works like a charm, processor is blazing fast,wifi 6 and bt 5.1 provides seemless connectivity, cutting one star because the display doesn't provide the customisation options, otherwise best laptop for students and even work professionalsüëçüëç
just awesomeall the things are best in this price rangeespecially displaylocal also better then othersbattery life is totally decent
I'm very excited to buy this product, but it turned out into very disappointment, on the day one itself , screen started flashing and the sound which is getting while flashing is very irritating, I thought of returning this product but the customer care is not at all responding today and atleast they are not providing technician for this....||This is not less amount to leave
I brought this laptop yesterday..... i'm writing review  based on my experience.....This laptop display is quite good... coming to battery it takes 2hrs to charge and it discharges within 3 hrs max even company said we get 6hrs of battery backup.... coming to speakers it doesnt reach my expectations.... it is bit low.... if we connect headphones we can able to hear outside noise..... coming to keyboard it is excellent with backlight.... this is my overal review
All good but issue with the seller.|_|display|:|Was excited for this laptop until it got delivered today and turns out to be a huge disappointed primarily due to its poor screen / display compared to the cost of the product wherever superiors display was expected as bare necessary.||I did observe that it charges up quickly.The only con I feel is that the colour scheme of display is slightly warmer in tone.||Display is good but don't expect MacBook type display for movies or online streaming, sound is ok but for zoom meetings it is very much sufficient.||Had some difficulty in typing as the keys are very near to each other.So overall i would say it was a pretty good experience except the web cam and the softness of the fonts/text display.While buying from Amazon please do check that the invoice and pslip has the laptop serial number mentioned in it.||Be as much attentive as you can be but you won't hear anything from the speakers, display is worst, battery backup also worst ...what good the processor can do when you can't see or hear anything.||But the processor is super fast in booting.... Not a solid keyboard make, which is a drawback along with poor screen display...||I always use it in dark room and low display üîÖ light so I don't find it a problem.||Decent display at this range.||Fast n convenient
Good product, value for money
Good product support
Best laptop and light weight
This laptop specs are very good but the only problem is the display.||I thought its a ips display but after using the laptop.||I can say display is very bad apart from display everything is awesome battery backup is 6-7 hours easily.||Overall amazing laptop...battery backup with light usage is around 10hours...and with YouTube and surfing - 6 to 7 hours....This is not gaming machine but still u can play fortnite @ low settings and get 100 to 150FPS ...BUT again it's not gaming machine...very handy laptop with slim design and portable charging option (Type c 65watt)
