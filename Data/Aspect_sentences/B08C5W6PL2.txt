overall the product is good ..thickness is very good......light weight ...and touch screen good....pubg gaming and cod gaming is not that good unless u add some graphic card or etc......the only problem is the display , but for this price range it is the best laptop for a collage students .........basic gaming is very good no lags ....and another problem is miscroft apps are paid apps , u need to buy them to use them......portable laptop......||Although the functionality of the devices will be limited, these are still quite capable devices.Coming to this particular device, What I love about this:The keyboard is surprisingly better than i was expecting at this price pointIt is a touch screen which I might not use, but will come in handy for most peoplethe trackpad is decentbattery life is greatThere is a bit of a learning curve but you will enjoy the deviceConsThe screen isn't full HDBuild quality is plastic, good plastic, but plastic nonethelessOverall, this Chromebook can be a daily use laptop for many people who are looking for Web Browsing, WFH and Basic task.Please don't expect this Chromebook to run premiere pro or photoshop.||Its a mind blowing purchase , At the very little cost you are getting a great quality product performance is mind blowing looks are mind blowing and if we compare it with the MacBook air it is giving a tough competition to it and chrome OS is mind blowing no lags know and complexity it is very easy to use and you have to think beyond Windows because windows constantly having problem like viruses lags crashing and all less battery back up but it has a battery backup of 12 hours, Believe in my words you would never regret if you have basic expectation With a mobile phone or laptop this is a wonderful device I recommend all an Amazon is wonderful and very helpful
Best laptop under this price range .||for every delete operation, we got to go to the end and press backspace ,which is irritating, also the power key is above the backspace key, and accidentally one can press the power key, which will turn off the laptop.overall it is a decent product for the price range it offers.||Overall good product to buy at this price range.||However, at this price, you can\'t get better.||You can set wallpaper on homescreen (From any source, Your files too) as well as Lockscreen (Only from Google Photos)Overall, "Can Try" device for this price point.||Works better than any other Windows laptop in this price segment since Chrome OS is very much optimised.||Touch scree is good by considering the price of this product but it is not comparable with high end devices.||Impressive Touch screen feature.over all a good experience in this price range (25k)
Purchased this nearly three months ago, as a replacement for another HP Chromebook (which had it's own set of issues, but that's a whole other story).For starters, the screen is terrible.||They are asking for than what this chromebook deserve it should be dil around ₹ 24k  because in USA its price was $ 279 which is around ₹ 22k.||So dear seller please reduce price to atleast ₹ 25k.||Though the trackpad is a bit draggy as compared to the other high end laptops, but one can smoothly function using the touch screen instead.The battery life is commendable (the best at this price range.)||Also overpriced as per information.||The next day of my order the price of the product sky rocketed.||May be it is such a valuable product that never again I saw its price coming down.||It is lightweight and thin.Super performance.Only draw back is as it is an android OS you will find it difficult to use word, excel, power point as you have to use online version of this application
Just got the chromebookIt's great for basic use ,boots up within seconds ,very fastFor the price screen quality could've been better also the storage ,the SD card protrudes out of the expandable slot
Bought this laptop for general use (browsing and office document editing).||The keyboard is also not responsive and feels cheaper than other laptops in the same price range.Unfortunately, I couldn't return the product as the one-week return window expired.||the product is reliably better at the price and best for surfing and writing, the cloud provides a dynamic role in storing and access ones work anywhere and anytime.||Overall good product at this low price.||\xa0Mobile bol kar sell karo na ki business laptop
Worth it and much better than laptops twice the price.||Not good
The laptop is good for the price.Battery backup, keyboard and trackpad are really good.||Wish it had a 1080p screen, but can't complain at this price
Super!||Worth

Amazing product for the price.||But ok for the price point* SDD size could have been 128GB instead of 64GB even for the price point* Youtube kids is forced upon in child account.||I don't under why people are buy overpriced/underpowered chromebooks", 'People can get a significantly better Windows Laptop and convert it into a Chromebook using emulation - the easy way or replace Windows if you are a nerd.||Battery lasts for a little over 10 hours on full charge.Yes the screen is only HD ready but they had to cut corners somewhere and you can't really complain at such a price point (29,000 at the time of my purchase).If you don't have any heavy apps to run or can do without windows based apps then you can easily go for this.||The chromebook is good the battery life is also good but the viewing angles are not that good although the price is reasonable.||The best part is that this laptop gives you a touchscreen display for a very affordable price.||Overall good product at this low price.”
