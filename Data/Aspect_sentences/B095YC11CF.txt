11th Gen i3 laptop for less than 40K is a dream come true - With 8GB RAM, I can stop worrying about slower performance with this laptop and the 1TB HDD gives me ample space for my needs.||Or refund my money.||Worst product don't waste money for this laptop....I don't like.||please act accordingly else rating remains same
Cant say that it is superb,  considering the price it works ok, a bit slow side, light weight and easy to handle and upgradeable to Windows 11 which works smoothly

Best Laptop around 40 k Hp has improved a lot on built quality over the year Good laptop for studyingOr Also GamingKeys-NO KEYBOARD BACKLITMSO FOR LIFETIME
Be honest if you used internet and 2,3 apps in background your charging will reduce faster only 3.30-4 hrs it's will give otherwise the laptop was awesome for regular use
Good in looks good to handle...||But remember it's such a slow that it take ageis to processActually feeling bad for is slowest processor ever seen
This laptop has become black and white and I could see pink lines coming through it......even the customer care aren't doing anything
