screen|:|During black screen, you can clearly see white light seeping in from the light source on the edges of the screen.||Touch screen works amazing though!||I particularly buy touch screen laptops as it makes for an amazing web browsing experience with one of my hand on the screen ready to scroll through content lot faster than track pad.||Even single clicks on OK and Agree are lot faster to tap on screen than move the cursor.3.||Awesome laptop, the screen quality is great, performance is awesome, don't go by the i3 moniker, has an all mettalic body, touchpad is large, the fingerprint scanner is fast, speakers are okay, battery backup is good, the SSD is super fast, boots in about 6 seconds, has 2 USB  Type A ports, one USB Type C port, one HDMI port, a 3.5 mm jack (headphone and microphone), an SD card slot and a barrel connector.||The touchscreen works pretty well.||If you need a nice screen increase your budget, but this is average for the price, still good but not the best you can get for the price.||And remember the touch screen is not that useful in day to day life unless you're drawing something or you're into reading a lot and arts, if this is not you go for a standard laptop not 2 in 1.So, a solid 7/10.For Gaming- A big NO, if you want to game this is the worst decision you would make, first of all i3 which is a good processor for day to day activities like chrome and work with word and other microsoft office tools, but that also if pushed to limits it'll start becoming slow, so, if you like to open up 10-15 tabs at once and do 4-5 projects at once this won't be your best choice, now if the laptop can't handle that it certainly cannot handle gaming ofcourse it can handle some small games but mostly nothing from the epic store so, if gaming is the main purpose look for i5 and non touch screen laptops.||Physical damage near the borders of the screen.Thanks to Amazon for their excellent customer care support.||Gets extremely hot within a few secs of turning it on..n way too heavy..also there is some screen damage or lighting issue at the top edge..Iâ€™ve seen similar reviews..didnâ€™t know it was just 7 days return period..missed it..just ensure a thorough check is done cos looks like Amazon is selling some not so good hp laptops
The media could not be loaded.||The laptop had major display issues after which I opted for replacement.The replacement was delivered on June 23, and after drivers update, worked fine apart from the battery issue.However, within a week, the screen started flickering badly when using on tablet mode (ss attached), and the battery performance on meetings was dismal (around 2-3 hours only).Amazon denied replacing the product again, and now I am stuck with the defected laptop with screen and battery issues, hoping for HP Warranty to come to my rescue.||Best touch screen operation in this laptop.||if you are a coder , gamer , student you should prefer for graphic card in the same budget in acer or asus as the touchscreen is of no use...else you can prefer for acer aspire which has a 15.6 inch screen size as well as graphics card of nvida..though after 15 days of usage the product is working good and has no issues you can go for it as i have used it at a high end for programming.||Touch screen feature is the highlight .||In my case screen hinges are loose and the screen corners are making a tuck sound while pressing a little.Bottom vent heats up significantly making it unusable on lap.||I got it at 18% discount rate .No other laptop can be compared with this laptop (512 gb ssd , touchscreen,8 gb ram , 11 th generation i-3 , backlit keyboard and 360  degree rotation )at this price range ( I bought it under 54 K on 3 rd June ,2021).I used hp laptop for the past 6 years.||After 20 days web cam is not working getting heatup and laptop screen damaged by technical engineer he came for web cam repair very bad experience with this product now they are not ready to replacement.||Productivity has increased after an upgrade.It will be nice if it detects the orientation and changes automatically.The most pointer gets stuck at times when you use both touchpad and the screen alternatively.||\xa0Best laptop in this budget.. go for it blindly
