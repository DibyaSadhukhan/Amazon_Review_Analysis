screen|:|A lot of information mentioned is wrong, it's not anti glare screen, it's not FHD", "When I tried to register on Lenovo website it said the product is already registered and I have just 8 months of warranty remaining, basically it's a used product, used for at least 4 months.Pros:1.||Not anti glare screen2.||It's 1280x800 screen, not FHD3.||The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time.||I tried installing linux (Ubuntu and Manjaro) it booted and installed successfully, by default they boot in portrait mode, you can rotate the screen from settings, but it doesn't rotate the touch, Manjaro sometimes caused black screen during screen rotation.||Overall, you can install linux but you'll have hard time using the touchscreen.Buy if you want to do basic things like editing office files, browsing, watching videos.||Product is good ,it's really grate.Small & compact.Good in speed , and its really easy to carry out station and using in car .Value for money.I felt little lagging when I swetch over to tab or computer.Sometimes apps will immediately shutdown and windows screen will appear.That may be some technical fault.||If you need something with on screen writing capabilities for occational use under budget and don't want compromise on core functionality of a laptop by going for a tablet......then this product is for you
Don't buy", "Don't buy.||I would strictly won't recommend it to adults although it runs basic programs but its only good for kids.Touchscreen is a good function for kids, it  being a laptop.It works better as laptop than tablet.Touchscreen is fine and S pen is smooth.Touch lags at times but its manageable.Performance is decent enough for online classes,streaming and basic gaming like roblox(preinstalled).||Sound from speakers is loud enough,screen looks fine too.||Dont think of it as powerful as your 5000Mah phone battery.My kid is super happy and it is really good for kids who have just started to learn computer n cannot b brisk with touchpad,they can use touchscreen.||The bezel of the screen is quite large that minimise the display.||Low quality, flimsy construction, poorly made and troublesome touchpad interface, non-existent after-sales...frankly you're better off buying any other brand than this piece of...
Hi,You can use the usb ports on keyboard as long as it is connected to the screen.|_|keyboard|:|You get keyboard and active pen in the boxCons:1.||Without keyboard attached you can't use USB, as both USBs are in the keyboard4.||Even without keyboard it feels heavy5.||The screen is a fingerprint magnet, you'll need a screen protectorOkayish cameras.It will take sometime to be used to the keyboard, it's small with low key travel.You can access the boot menu by pressing fn+f12.It is possible to run Linux but issues with screen orientation and touchscreen will give you hard time.||Overall performance average,can open 2-3 programs simultaneously and it works.But the build quality is so poor that i have already glued keyboard keys using feviquick,so be ready with feviquick.||Its functions ok as a laptop and can do basic office n entertainment work,its small to carry but again not good for traveling and writing just cz keyboard is not that great,if you type with speed its not for you.||Inform kids to handle it with care and yes keep feviquick handy.a slightly better keyboard dock would have made it 5star product.||Low quality, flimsy construction, poorly made and troublesome touchpad interface, non-existent after-sales...frankly you're better off buying any other brand than this piece of...
