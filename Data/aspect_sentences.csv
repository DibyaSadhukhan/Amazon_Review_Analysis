403,B0928NL6F3,time,Battery backup is very less (3-4 hours only) about half the time boasted on the website.
404,B0928NL6F3,time,"Amazon and HP support not available at all, it just says try again later all the time."
405,B0928NL6F3,time,Hp customer care takes time to respond.

Pros - Good touch screen, kids can use it comfortably, light weight, not much learning curve for kids from Android, good sound, good mic quality.Cons - No HDMI if you want to use external monitor, only USB-C. No caps lock.Improvement - Mic on off button like audio on off would have been good for kids use.if you look for a kids online class no doubt can go ahead."
442,B08C5W6PL2,screen,"Though the trackpad is a bit draggy as compared to the other high end laptops, but one can smoothly function using the touch screen instead.The battery life is commendable (the best at this price range.)"

Here is my Review after Using it for three days :best use case :- online class(Students)Pros- the battery life is great I'd say it lasts nearly 6 hr while watching lectures n doing some extra work simultaneously- the os is flawlessly fast and doesn't feel like it's working with 4 gigs of ram- the body comes with matt finish looks good plus the weight distribution is good too.- this comes with Linux which runs sidewise the chrome os which can be used for light development purpose and problem-solving (coding) purpose- I didn't felt any lag while multitasking even with many of chrome tabs open- support most of the native apps from the play store- boots up real quick like is 3-4 seconds and the touchpad is super smoothCons- you will face a Lil prob if you switch from the 1080p- the keyboard is clumsy and doesn't feel that good for regular use (try external ones)- only one USB type a port ( either you can buy type c dongle or use Bluetooth mouse)- memory can be an issue for few people as its only 64 GB- not regular sized like 15.6 inch (becomes even handier)Conclusion - People who work on excel, words, ppt, attends online class and meeting and does programming (not development like data science, Android or game dev).Good luck ‚ö°

Here is my Review after Using it for three days :best use case :- online class(Students)Pros- the battery life is great I'd say it lasts nearly 6 hr while watching lectures n doing some extra work simultaneously- the os is flawlessly fast and doesn't feel like it's working with 4 gigs of ram- the body comes with matt finish looks good plus the weight distribution is good too.- this comes with Linux which runs sidewise the chrome os which can be used for light development purpose and problem-solving (coding) purpose- I didn't felt any lag while multitasking even with many of chrome tabs open- support most of the native apps from the play store- boots up real quick like is 3-4 seconds and the touchpad is super smoothCons- you will face a Lil prob if you switch from the 1080p- the keyboard is clumsy and doesn't feel that good for regular use (try external ones)- only one USB type a port ( either you can buy type c dongle or use Bluetooth mouse)- memory can be an issue for few people as its only 64 GB- not regular sized like 15.6 inch (becomes even handier)Conclusion - People who work on excel, words, ppt, attends online class and meeting and does programming (not development like data science, Android or game dev).Good luck ‚ö°

871,B083RD58F6,price,"This is a nice laptop with sufficient processing capabilities at such a low price point.I bought this laptop for Just 27K, and things that this laptop has are mind-blowing.Office Home & student with lifetime license.Windows 10 home.Ryzen CpuVega Graphics7+ hours of battery backup.An empty slot for RAM.I'm going to upgrade the RAM to 16GB and replace the hard drive with an SSD and the system will easily become my secondary driver.The only things that I'll miss are:1) Full HD screen resolution2) 8-bit (16.7M colors) display (this one is 6 bit(252K colors) only)3) Backlit keyboard.Update:I have upgraded both RAM and Storage."

The Laptop is Good in general and overall.It is very fast in boot up & shut down in less than 15 sec.The given windows 10 with Office is very Good with several update features.Several minor inconveniences are there as follows : It comes with single 256 gb SSD and in it windows would ever need more than some 50gb.Leaving that Lenovo should have created a part of 200gb as separate virtual disc for user convenience and safety of system.But they left it as single open disc.For General users it will be hard job to create a virtual disc needing expert services .This system can accomodate one more SSD for increasing storage capacity but no where details provided as required for user how to install it.They should have exclusively provided info on this.All 3 usb ports + HDMI port all inline beside power adopter point at left side.Seems like a design for left handers.Such like this provision is not convenient.For cable mouse left to right cable has to run around for a Right hander.It boasts of a finger print reader in power button but no where it is mentioned how to set it.Other than these points well satisfied with this Laptop and hope it will give expected service life."

1347,B098P62W63,battery,\xa0I bought this product 2 days before and the product which was delivered to me was the worst defective peice ...the speakers were damaged and not producing the full sound ..it's recorded in phone that's why it's loud but in love the sound is not good and the voice is not heard and the surrounding sound doesn't works and the battery life drains in low performance i.e within one hour ...
1348,B098P62W63,battery,The backlit keyboard is awesome too.The battery is okay.
1349,B098P62W63,battery,Initial Impressions:Such a good looking laptop with a great display 144hz under 62KAfter 2 weeks update: Games are stuttering and getting fps drops upto 100fps drop in both battery and wall adapter and now battery only lasts 45 min in battery saver mode.Amazon  can't help me as return period is over.
1350,B098P62W63,battery,Good thing is the laptop charges very fast.Gaming will drain the battery to fast so the best option is to use the wall adapter as it gives extra frames when in turbo mode.Charger gets very hot when Gaming.144hz screen is just too good for this laptop.I like the metallic finish in this version of the laptop( Fortress grey color is very nice in person gives a slight bluish metallic feel when light strikes it.)
1351,B098P62W63,battery,"I would close my eyes and buy this laptop if your budget is 62k range.Note: Wait for Great Indian Sale guys
Laptop is good and perfect.....I thought at the laptop is screen ...Then I got replacement also but the reality..On battery power by default the laptop set to 60hz when ever you Plug in it changes from 60 to 144hz and when u plug out 144 to 60hz so this is why it 2 sec time screen gets off and on.....No issue in it....If you want to get rid it means right click on desktop and got display settings and goto advance system setting change 60 to 144hz then your laptop will 144hz during on battery power also then screen will not off...*Performance - 5/5*Display- 5/5*Battery- 4/5 on normal usage 3-4 hours  easily we are getting

1353,B098P62W63,battery,"\xa0Laptop screen turns off after running for a while and then comes back on
I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Watch Dogs 2,Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2,and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great,everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e,gaming.Now for the cons..this laptop gets waaay too loud while gaming.I use headphones and i can still listen to the noise if the volume is low.I was using a PC before so i havent experienced this kind of sound.Now comes the battery backup which is absolutely pathetic.U can barely use this laptop for 1 hour 30 mins while doing normal stuff.The backup is very bad.The other problems i faced is that the adapter gets waaay too hot and i mean it,way too hot while gaming.I plugged it in for 3 hours while gaming and it gets so hot that i almost couldn't touch it.I have to stop between my gaming sessions and unplug the charger for it to cool down which is very frustrating since i was using a PC before and never had to face this kind of problem.Now comes the camera.The camera is...bad,just bad.I would never use it for anything,i would rather use my phone camera for meetings and other stuff.So in conclusion this laptop is good for gaming while plugged in,but for watching movies with backup power,its not great and u can watch only a 2hour movie at most.I would give this laptop a 7/10."
1354,B098P62W63,battery,\xa0First purchaseI am facing this problem ( when switching on the power the screen is going black for 2 sec and again when going back to battery same thing is happening ) and the asus customer care executive are saying it's default because of 144 Hz.After ReplacementSame issue is prevailing.My experience with ASUS is not at all good.
1355,B098P62W63,battery,"Overall I loved display, battery life and speaker."
1356,B098P62W63,battery,"So I didn't feel any thermal issue.Only one drwaback that is it's battery life but we didn't expect battery with gaming laptops so it's  the only issue else when you plug in it to charger it's screen got off for few seconds and when you remove charger again it's screen going off for few seconds , First I think it's a detactive after that I call service center they told that when you plug it  to charger then it's display using 144 Hz and when you remove charger it's screen using 60 Hz that's the reason of that, you can resolve this problem by going to display setting > Advanced settings > and their a option 60/144Hz."
1357,B098P62W63,battery,But 144 Hz consume more battery .

1362,B098P62W63,battery,"So I am not rating any star for gaming.I will do hardcore test, Will definitely give more review in coming days regarding gaming and battery.For the time being Overall product is a Good Buy."

1364,B098P62W63,battery,"Great entry/mid level gaming laptop, excellent build quality and ergonomics, of course don't be expecting great battery life on this but it can hold up to about 3-4 hours easily (not while gaming though), It can pretty much run any AAA titles on medium at 1080p 60fps (Can crank up some older games to high/ultra) with no lag whatsoever and that 144hz refresh panel while playing FPS games like Doom or CSGO is so satisfying!"
1365,B098P62W63,battery,"\xa0laptops performance so good but one genuine issue battery backup only 2 hrs backupIn product description: mention time 6,7 hrsSo if you want battery backup don't go for itI am only disappointed with battery issue

1366,B098P62W63,battery,On battery its good but battery drain fast while gaming when not plugged in (charging)No heating on laptop body but inside its about 60¬∞- 90¬∞ thanks to fans in laptop that keeps it cool.Laptop body is strong but don't know if its scratch resistant.If you are going to use it for work which includes designing or photoshop the display is not made for it.No finger print unlock and face unlock.camera is 720p but not good.If you want to do gaming in low budget go for it.
1367,B098P62W63,battery,"The finishing and materials used is very good as it is tuf series.The overall performance is good in this segment the main drawback is battery life is too less around 2 hrs with compare to the others, upgradibilty is good option with 32 gb of RAM, 1 ssd and 1 hdd."
1368,B098P62W63,battery,"\xa0been using this from 3 days nd i have to say the build quality of the laptop is top notch although its completely plastic build but feel sturdy nd premium as well now talking about the performance oh man oh man as i mentioned this machine is beast this is meant to give dhasu performance in every aspect now as this is a gaming laptop so it can run most of the game without any stress but one thing i didn't like much the battery performance nd the web cam bit also this is gaming laptop so i can understand about Battery so the conclusion is if you the budget nd your looking for a gaming laptop with closed eyes go for this you will never regret this is the best gaming laptop under 60küòé‚ö°üî•
The battery lasts about 55 to 70 minutes maximum.Even in general usage.Laptop is sturdy in built but the battery life of less than an hour is disappointing with the normal browsing.This sounds a good deal until you start using it and battery disappoints you every 40 mins."
1369,B098P62W63,battery,\xa0Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source.
1370,B098P62W63,battery,"it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine."
1371,B098P62W63,battery,Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....
1372,B098P62W63,battery,"For browsing and online classes, the battery may last upto more than 3¬Ω-5 hours on full charge."
1373,B098P62W63,battery,"But the baterry is on average..
A product that stand near it's promises,if you're mid range gamer then this is your laptop for sure.screen quality isn't that good in sunlight,About battery life as you can see any laptop you buy for gaming don't give you that much battery while playing without charging
Very nice laptop but only bad thing that it has a very short battery
This is first day of my Laptop, The Look and Body is what i was expecting it to be, the speakers are very good and loud ..but a little disappointed with the loud noise of the fans even in silent mode, in turbo its like a hair dryer,writing this as this is my first feel of the product ..have to check about battery and performance."

1377,B098P62W63,battery,"Overall it's a good laptop bt the performance is slow while multitasking and video editing
The laptop is very decent for gaming, but the battery is the main issue for me althought the camera is very bad aswell i will overlook that, the battery only lasts for about 5 hrs on battery saver mode while the advertisment was upto 9hrs of video playback but when i use chrome to watch youtube or other things like amazon prime the battery barely lasts for 5hrs

1423,B098P62W63,battery,"So far in use for about 1 n half month and no problems.. games like apex legends, farcry5, forza4, days gone run above 70 fps..and the 144hz really ia amazing for multiplayer overall its a good gaming laptop but interms of battery gaming it only gives 30fps and does not even last for 1n half hour for gaming normal coding and offc work it will last for 2 n half or 3 hours.. but it gets kinda hot while big games.. its okay if the room temperature ia maintained.. id definitely suggest in this in this price warzone only gives 55-60 fps in medium settings but in low it can boost upto 70 fps.. for a 60k laptop its great, valorant above 130 fps
Great productSmooth like ButterPerformance like Beast
Buy it without any second thought for gaming."

1425,B098P62W63,battery,"Best laptop but battery backup is less butBuy itBeast
Everything is fine but it's not detecting the external DVD writer."
1426,B098P62W63,gaming,"If ur budget is approx 60k then close ur eyes and buy this without any doubt.......
OverPowered Specs for the price!The laptop comes with pre-loaded Windows 10 Home with all essential apps like Word, PPT, ect.TUF metal and plastic Build!The coolers keep the laptop very cool.RGB is very good and even the brightness of the rgb keyboard is adjustible!The camera is decent.i5 10300H with GTX 1650 is a good combo for gaming and you can get upto 120fps for Valorant.The 144hz fhd display is Killer!Go for it!"
1427,B098P62W63,gaming,lets hope i dont face any problems if any happens i'll update here also.The settings for gaming are very diffiult to understand !
1428,B098P62W63,gaming,For a normal user the display is crisp and punchy.2)performance is top notch for 1080p gaming i get 144fps constant while plugged in valorant (this is the only videogame i play.
1429,B098P62W63,gaming,)3) battery is above average i got around 3-4 hrs of screen onn time with normal use and 1.5-2 hrs wits gaming depending on graphical settings.
1430,B098P62W63,gaming,Thanks to ssd.5)The design of this laptop is really catchy but at the same time it doesn't scream gaming.
1431,B098P62W63,gaming,I won't recommend using the laptop keyboard for gaming as it might not last for long period.
1432,B098P62W63,gaming,"\xa0Laptop screen turns off after running for a while and then comes back on
I have used this laptop for almost a week now.I found many pro's as well as cons while using this laptop.First the pros..I tested many games like Assassin's Creed Valhalla,Watch Dogs 2,Destiny 2.No problem whatsoever while gaming.Really good fps in older games like Destiny 2 and Watch Dogs 2,and decent fps in newer titles like AC Valhalla.Some setting tweak and it is possible to get almost 60 fps in Valhalla.The 144hz screen is really great,everything feels smooth tho i wont use it cause the screen is too small.I connected the laptop using hdmi to a monitor.The rgb keyboard is a nice touch.Overall it does what it is good at i.e,gaming.Now for the cons..this laptop gets waaay too loud while gaming.I use headphones and i can still listen to the noise if the volume is low.I was using a PC before so i havent experienced this kind of sound.Now comes the battery backup which is absolutely pathetic.U can barely use this laptop for 1 hour 30 mins while doing normal stuff.The backup is very bad.The other problems i faced is that the adapter gets waaay too hot and i mean it,way too hot while gaming.I plugged it in for 3 hours while gaming and it gets so hot that i almost couldn't touch it.I have to stop between my gaming sessions and unplug the charger for it to cool down which is very frustrating since i was using a PC before and never had to face this kind of problem.Now comes the camera.The camera is...bad,just bad.I would never use it for anything,i would rather use my phone camera for meetings and other stuff.So in conclusion this laptop is good for gaming while plugged in,but for watching movies with backup power,its not great and u can watch only a 2hour movie at most.I would give this laptop a 7/10."
1433,B098P62W63,gaming,Product works fine for casual gaming.

1437,B098P62W63,gaming,It is beast and highly recommend for gaming and normal use.
1438,B098P62W63,gaming,"So I didn't feel any thermal issue.Only one drwaback that is it's battery life but we didn't expect battery with gaming laptops so it's  the only issue else when you plug in it to charger it's screen got off for few seconds and when you remove charger again it's screen going off for few seconds , First I think it's a detactive after that I call service center they told that when you plug it  to charger then it's display using 144 Hz and when you remove charger it's screen using 60 Hz that's the reason of that, you can resolve this problem by going to display setting > Advanced settings > and their a option 60/144Hz."

Received the product in record time, barely 17 hours in perfect packaging condition."
1444,B098P62W63,gaming,"The 144Hz display is excellent and has made the UI very snappy and the difference is noticeable.Battery- It's a gaming laptop, so as expected  3-3.5 hours for normal tasks.Build Quality- Excellent."
1445,B098P62W63,gaming,"So I am not rating any star for gaming.I will do hardcore test, Will definitely give more review in coming days regarding gaming and battery.For the time being Overall product is a Good Buy."
1446,B098P62W63,gaming,It is a very good laptop for gaming ang productive work like online office or classes.
1447,B098P62W63,gaming,"It is an absolute value for money, best for gaming in budget, and for using CAD and other designing softwares."
1448,B098P62W63,gaming,"ASUS should look into that as it is mianly used by students so MS Office is a critical feature for the students.For gaming, i would suggest 60hz for such games which don't require too much usage, but for heavy games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and many newer games switching to 144hz with laptop charging on will give you best performance."
1449,B098P62W63,gaming,i would recommend this laptop for students and for them who are interested in gaming.
1450,B098P62W63,gaming,"Display is really good with 144hz refresh rate.Backlit keyboard is a very good touchBattery back up is decentBoots up in 4-5 seconds
What could I say more, it's awesome laptop, excellent performance for gaming, heavy coding and for other video related editing works, got this around 62k, good colorization and everything's great, screen is awesome no worries such as screen bleeding."
1451,B098P62W63,gaming,"Im not a gamer so i can't comment on gaming side, but as a programmer, it can handle heavy lifting with huge IDEs in parallel and also multi threading programs are so close to my server."
1452,B098P62W63,gaming,"Great entry/mid level gaming laptop, excellent build quality and ergonomics, of course don't be expecting great battery life on this but it can hold up to about 3-4 hours easily (not while gaming though), It can pretty much run any AAA titles on medium at 1080p 60fps (Can crank up some older games to high/ultra) with no lag whatsoever and that 144hz refresh panel while playing FPS games like Doom or CSGO is so satisfying!"
1453,B098P62W63,gaming,Overall a great portable gaming station....
1454,B098P62W63,gaming,"\xa0The touch pad is came outside when i press it it goes to normap and after 2 minutes it comes outside again
Coming with a decently equipped hardware, the specs on this laptop are a treat for those who are buying this as their first gaming laptop."
1455,B098P62W63,gaming,On battery its good but battery drain fast while gaming when not plugged in (charging)No heating on laptop body but inside its about 60¬∞- 90¬∞ thanks to fans in laptop that keeps it cool.Laptop body is strong but don't know if its scratch resistant.If you are going to use it for work which includes designing or photoshop the display is not made for it.No finger print unlock and face unlock.camera is 720p but not good.If you want to do gaming in low budget go for it.
1456,B098P62W63,gaming,"The laptop speed/performance/display/graphics is good.A bit bulky but then 15.6 inch gaming laptops are not very mobile anyway
A pack of awesome-ness from asus."
1457,B098P62W63,gaming,"Amazing laptop for the price, if you want to go for a budget gaming laptop this should be your go to, upgradability is also very good with empty slots for easy upgrade of ram and ssd
Excellent performance in all respects."
1458,B098P62W63,gaming,"\xa0been using this from 3 days nd i have to say the build quality of the laptop is top notch although its completely plastic build but feel sturdy nd premium as well now talking about the performance oh man oh man as i mentioned this machine is beast this is meant to give dhasu performance in every aspect now as this is a gaming laptop so it can run most of the game without any stress but one thing i didn't like much the battery performance nd the web cam bit also this is gaming laptop so i can understand about Battery so the conclusion is if you the budget nd your looking for a gaming laptop with closed eyes go for this you will never regret this is the best gaming laptop under 60küòé‚ö°üî•
The battery lasts about 55 to 70 minutes maximum.Even in general usage.Laptop is sturdy in built but the battery life of less than an hour is disappointing with the normal browsing.This sounds a good deal until you start using it and battery disappoints you every 40 mins."
1459,B098P62W63,gaming,\xa0Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source.
1460,B098P62W63,gaming,"it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine."
1461,B098P62W63,gaming,Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....
1462,B098P62W63,gaming,Great for gaming with different software adaptation modes.
1463,B098P62W63,gaming,"I'm not a heavy gaming type but i used it for video editing , coding, and programming..."
1464,B098P62W63,gaming,"But the baterry is on average..
A product that stand near it's promises,if you're mid range gamer then this is your laptop for sure.screen quality isn't that good in sunlight,About battery life as you can see any laptop you buy for gaming don't give you that much battery while playing without charging
Very nice laptop but only bad thing that it has a very short battery
This is first day of my Laptop, The Look and Body is what i was expecting it to be, the speakers are very good and loud ..but a little disappointed with the loud noise of the fans even in silent mode, in turbo its like a hair dryer,writing this as this is my first feel of the product ..have to check about battery and performance."
1465,B098P62W63,gaming,\xa0If you are doing only gaming then it will be provide you best experience.

The laptop is very decent for gaming, but the battery is the main issue for me althought the camera is very bad aswell i will overlook that, the battery only lasts for about 5 hrs on battery saver mode while the advertisment was upto 9hrs of video playback but when i use chrome to watch youtube or other things like amazon prime the battery barely lasts for 5hrs

1512,B098P62W63,gaming,"This particular laptop at 62K is a bargain IPS display at 144hz is a gangster, blacks are awesome, Call of Duty Warzone is amazing, although RTX will be even better but you cannot expect RTX at this price, I don't think there is a better laptop than this in Amazon India right now with with i5 chip at this price either gaming or non-gaming."
1513,B098P62W63,gaming,An ideal gaming laptop with RGB keyboard and super bright screen -- this is one of my best purchases ever!
1514,B098P62W63,gaming,This is the best gaming laptop at this price.
1515,B098P62W63,gaming,"\xa0This is the best laptop with the price range i can say, for gaming its perfect with 144hz refresh rate can get max 120fps with lowest settings and with high arround 70-80fps which is actually very good."
1516,B098P62W63,gaming,Then battery is also okok as its a gaming laptop so u cant expect more.. but yes its fine.
1517,B098P62W63,gaming,"This is best gaming laptop with many features, also got Window 11 update as I boot up this."
1518,B098P62W63,gaming,I turn on my AC and the temps doesn't cross 88¬∞C which is normal for a gaming laptop.
1519,B098P62W63,gaming,I like most is graphics and gaming is awesome big games like GTA 5; nfs pay back ; call of duty almost all heavy games are run in smoothly with perfect 144 hz display any way almost awesome laptop for gaming and student laptop also these laptop is good both gaming and student go for this laptop ......
1520,B098P62W63,gaming,"Overall a Best budget friendly gaming laptop but but the only problem is Battery life
Everything is good in this laptop ..every single features is just wow but wo bat hai na achi chiz me ek burai rhegi wo hai battery life(very poor)..It is written that battery life is 7hrs(mazak hai kyaüòÜ)..Hardly 4hrs in normal usage and watching flims you can get upto max 5hrs

Best laptop and work simultaneously gaming and any work and all over Best Quality Best price and screen good quality body üëåüëç
I m writing this review after 2 weeks of laptop use,Laptop perfomance is good but battery life stay for 2 hrs max with normal use."
1526,B098P62W63,gaming,"Upgrade the ram to 16gb as it's a sweetspot for gaming, multi-tasking...... although without it it's still the budget king...."
1527,B098P62W63,gaming,"This is TUF
Very nice gaming laptop in this price üëç üëç  üëç üëç , only the battery life was short, otherwise very nice....."
1528,B098P62W63,gaming,"So far in use for about 1 n half month and no problems.. games like apex legends, farcry5, forza4, days gone run above 70 fps..and the 144hz really ia amazing for multiplayer overall its a good gaming laptop but interms of battery gaming it only gives 30fps and does not even last for 1n half hour for gaming normal coding and offc work it will last for 2 n half or 3 hours.. but it gets kinda hot while big games.. its okay if the room temperature ia maintained.. id definitely suggest in this in this price warzone only gives 55-60 fps in medium settings but in low it can boost upto 70 fps.. for a 60k laptop its great, valorant above 130 fps
Great productSmooth like ButterPerformance like Beast
Buy it without any second thought for gaming."
1529,B098P62W63,performance,Great performance on heavy audio editing software.2.
1530,B098P62W63,performance,Battery performance is ok.
1531,B098P62W63,performance,"I must say it now ..the laptop lacks regularity in performance....during my office works, it stops running and screen get black....then after some time  it starts repairing processes initiated automatically without permission.....my  work got deadlines but thanks to this lappy...its dead now....One last thing to say to amazon...please check product working before selling...people buy products from your app not from retailers... trust issues are going to pits thanks to such sellers."
1532,B098P62W63,performance,For a normal user the display is crisp and punchy.2)performance is top notch for 1080p gaming i get 144fps constant while plugged in valorant (this is the only videogame i play.
1533,B098P62W63,performance,And its really fast.Cons-1) Due to rgb keyboard and 144hz display the storage option on this perticular model is 512gb and for higher storage option u have to go for the more expensive varient.2)The storage here is 512gb but after all the windows installation and bloatware from both asus and microsoft we are left wits around 418gb which may seem a lot but isn't enough for a power user like me.3)Asus's armoury crate in this laptop is pretty much useless as there aren't many customisation options available.there are only performance customisation which i think also customise the fan speed and rgb customisation which include only 4 options as its one zone rgb keyboard.4) camera on this laptop is straight up trash though it claims to be 720p but the video is really grainy even in good light.5)this may be nitpicking but asus claim this laptop to be military grade durable and i doubt that as there is flex in deck as well as screen.
1534,B098P62W63,performance,\xa0I bought this product 2 days before and the product which was delivered to me was the worst defective peice ...the speakers were damaged and not producing the full sound ..it's recorded in phone that's why it's loud but in love the sound is not good and the voice is not heard and the surrounding sound doesn't works and the battery life drains in low performance i.e within one hour ...
1535,B098P62W63,performance,"\xa0All thing is good sound quality is nice but not so loud , camera is below average, booting time is awesome, heavy but very thin laptop battery backup is ok , the dhansu RGB backlit keypad is awesome and also wasd keys are highlighted, I haven't tried a game yet so I'll edit the review for performance impreasion in some days."
1536,B098P62W63,performance,"Getting close to 50-60 fps on high setting in AAA titles, and some with 30-40 in ultra setting.The laptop is a bit noisy during gameplay but is silent when performance is not need (daily tasks and surfing).Good job to Amazon for delivering me this laptop under 2 working days!!"
1537,B098P62W63,performance,"Beautiful outside and inside, great display, good performance while gaming."
1538,B098P62W63,performance,Must use a laptop stand with fans while running on turbo mode Armory crate in asus is amazing for switching in between performance silent and turbo as per uses.
1539,B098P62W63,performance,It gives a very high performance even on charging4.
1540,B098P62W63,performance,"Buy this laptop, if you really just need an i5 over the current processor you have (I had an i3 7th Gen) and a dedicated graphics card (I didn‚Äôt have) over an equivalent 11th Gen as the prices are much lower now and performance gains are hardly around 10-20% more."
1541,B098P62W63,performance,"In a few months, once the 12th Gen series arrive, this laptop will simply be a no go as those offer better security other than simply performance gains."
1542,B098P62W63,performance,It's not glass so I don't expect Macbook level smoothness.SSD- Very fast boot speed.Performance- The performance is excellent.
1543,B098P62W63,performance,"ASUS should look into that as it is mianly used by students so MS Office is a critical feature for the students.For gaming, i would suggest 60hz for such games which don't require too much usage, but for heavy games such as Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and many newer games switching to 144hz with laptop charging on will give you best performance."
1544,B098P62W63,performance,"I review it after a month , performance is great there is no lags in display the built  quality is also superb you never feel it's plastic body, it,s like a metal which is good."
1545,B098P62W63,performance,So all the performance and quality is good you can buy without hesitation.
1546,B098P62W63,performance,"I would say overall the build quality is far better with this price range it has military grade tested acknowledgement, when it comes with performance its too supportive for high end software."
1547,B098P62W63,performance,"Display is really good with 144hz refresh rate.Backlit keyboard is a very good touchBattery back up is decentBoots up in 4-5 seconds
What could I say more, it's awesome laptop, excellent performance for gaming, heavy coding and for other video related editing works, got this around 62k, good colorization and everything's great, screen is awesome no worries such as screen bleeding."
1548,B098P62W63,performance,"\xa0laptops performance so good but one genuine issue battery backup only 2 hrs backupIn product description: mention time 6,7 hrsSo if you want battery backup don't go for itI am only disappointed with battery issue
The media could not be loaded."
1549,B098P62W63,performance,"The finishing and materials used is very good as it is tuf series.The overall performance is good in this segment the main drawback is battery life is too less around 2 hrs with compare to the others, upgradibilty is good option with 32 gb of RAM, 1 ssd and 1 hdd."
1550,B098P62W63,performance,"The laptop speed/performance/display/graphics is good.A bit bulky but then 15.6 inch gaming laptops are not very mobile anyway
A pack of awesome-ness from asus."
1551,B098P62W63,performance,But performance and looks are great.
1552,B098P62W63,performance,"Amazing laptop for the price, if you want to go for a budget gaming laptop this should be your go to, upgradability is also very good with empty slots for easy upgrade of ram and ssd
Excellent performance in all respects."
1553,B098P62W63,performance,"If someone wants to purchase a high performance laptop, then he/she can go for it."
1554,B098P62W63,performance,"\xa0been using this from 3 days nd i have to say the build quality of the laptop is top notch although its completely plastic build but feel sturdy nd premium as well now talking about the performance oh man oh man as i mentioned this machine is beast this is meant to give dhasu performance in every aspect now as this is a gaming laptop so it can run most of the game without any stress but one thing i didn't like much the battery performance nd the web cam bit also this is gaming laptop so i can understand about Battery so the conclusion is if you the budget nd your looking for a gaming laptop with closed eyes go for this you will never regret this is the best gaming laptop under 60küòé‚ö°üî•
The battery lasts about 55 to 70 minutes maximum.Even in general usage.Laptop is sturdy in built but the battery life of less than an hour is disappointing with the normal browsing.This sounds a good deal until you start using it and battery disappoints you every 40 mins."
1555,B098P62W63,performance,"it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine."
1556,B098P62W63,performance,"\xa0Look wise it's stunning laptop,I will recommend for those who want hardcore performance,good build quality and great features."
1557,B098P62W63,performance,Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....
1558,B098P62W63,performance,"But the baterry is on average..
A product that stand near it's promises,if you're mid range gamer then this is your laptop for sure.screen quality isn't that good in sunlight,About battery life as you can see any laptop you buy for gaming don't give you that much battery while playing without charging
Very nice laptop but only bad thing that it has a very short battery
This is first day of my Laptop, The Look and Body is what i was expecting it to be, the speakers are very good and loud ..but a little disappointed with the loud noise of the fans even in silent mode, in turbo its like a hair dryer,writing this as this is my first feel of the product ..have to check about battery and performance."
1559,B098P62W63,performance,"\xa0like this asus tuf f15 gaming lapBetter performance for game notedNo lagging for Adobe premier pro editingSuper display and refreshing rate 144 hzSound goodOne of the best product in this section I thinkCamera is okBattery life 4-5 hrsFast chargingThis product is valueable for 61 k I think
Guys After i received my laptop i checked screen bleeding test."
1560,B098P62W63,performance,"Overall it's a good laptop bt the performance is slow while multitasking and video editing
The laptop is very decent for gaming, but the battery is the main issue for me althought the camera is very bad aswell i will overlook that, the battery only lasts for about 5 hrs on battery saver mode while the advertisment was upto 9hrs of video playback but when i use chrome to watch youtube or other things like amazon prime the battery barely lasts for 5hrs

1606,B098P62W63,price,Only hiccup I have is that it should have come with Office 365 free for a year as how it comes with other laptops which are less than its price range.
1607,B098P62W63,price,This is the best in this price range.
1608,B098P62W63,price,"I would say overall the build quality is far better with this price range it has military grade tested acknowledgement, when it comes with performance its too supportive for high end software."
1609,B098P62W63,price,Probably the best laptop that you can get from Asus for this price range (Around 62k when I got it).
1610,B098P62W63,price,This kind of specs do come at a price though.
1611,B098P62W63,price,(1+2 years extended warranty + 1 year accidental damage protection from asus website for 3.3k not included in laptop's price)I suggest you to play paid games not pirated games to keep your laptop in best condition.I uninstalled pre installed antivirus.I trust windows defender.This laptop can run GTA V and watchdogs 2 like butter on ultra settings when pluged in (charging).
1612,B098P62W63,price,Got it under 62K best perfomance under this price range.
1613,B098P62W63,price,"Amazing laptop for the price, if you want to go for a budget gaming laptop this should be your go to, upgradability is also very good with empty slots for easy upgrade of ram and ssd
Excellent performance in all respects."
1614,B098P62W63,price,\xa0Awesome laptop for multitasking in this price range RGB keyboard is awesome and it takes around 4-5 secs to boot all because of SSD I believe and also there are no heating issues found battery lasts around 3hrs if we continuosly listen online classes it can be upgraded to Win 11  The only thing disappointed me is this variant is without MS office activated  camera quality is very good I expected a more battery life but as it is a gaming laptop the battery backup is ok and thanks to honeycomb design it really helps in heat dissipation as mentioned it meets military standards and when in charging turbo mode is activated which helps a lot only one small suggestion plz keep refresh rate @144Hz so that you will not face any screen blank issue for 2-3 secs when you connect or disconnect power source.
1615,B098P62W63,price,"it is made for those who are looking for daily usage with lil bit higher performance @ price point of 60k and 65k3.it has fake thermal vents i will explain why it has got them at the bottom.because asus claims that it has got self cleaning fans to keep the fans safe from dust and etc they made ventilation beside the fans so that it will do cooling as well as protets fans to keep your laptop long life lasting4.no battrry issue as this is gaming laptop u have to use it on charging mode only5.it is futuristic laptop better than lenovo legion 5 and hp gaming laptop at this price point6.just go for it
Okay bought This in the sale for 58K , I agree with most of the comments for the pros , So I'm only going to talk about the consIf you are a student , want to code and stuff , and less gaming , it's great , the only major issue is the Battery life  , it doesn't last that long , Gave me about 3 hrs of runtime while setuping it , the decrease rate of battery percentage was noticable .....I would suggest looking for other laptop with more battery life  if your main focus is productivity rather than gamingSo in short yeah the battery sucks , and for other stuff it's a beast üî•
I Just Feel like the battery drains faster than you could imagine."
1616,B098P62W63,price,Then go for it...it will worth of price...Yes there is some issue for battery bcz its hold only 2:30 - 3:30 hrs battery backup..but if u want this type of performance and build quality you have to adjust somewhere....And if you only want for official use then u can go for another laptop which have good battery life....but in this laptop there are lot of new features like asus armour crate which gives you customise your all laptop setting like lighting and performance quality and hats off for that.....for heavy software and gaming this laptop is just god in this price seg...I bought in sale around 55000rs...so my final recommention will be take this laptop and just feel it's power....
1617,B098P62W63,price,"*Currently using since past 7 days & I will post a detailed review in couple of months

Pros :1."

2096,B09CMMMV11,tab,"It's not for hardcore work (coding/video editing, number crunching using ms office / high end windows softwares)Pros- Compact form factor.- Decent Built Quality, it's plastic but does not feel cheap.- Awesome battery life (10-13 hrs), mostly performs better than my phone and windows laptop.- Fast Charging (45 mins, 0 to100%), 45W Charger which is USB type C, and not like the usual bulky laptop chargers.- Specs are decent enough to support the OS, Apps and all rest of the functionality, the laptop is quick to load and takes almost everything u throw at it without really stuttering.- I think it's far better than a tab with the option of working as a full laptop and convertible to a tab which can do landscape/portrait modes like a charm.- Awesome backlit keyboard, feels way better than most of the windows ones in this price, also they keyboard gets disabled when rotated so no issues on keys getting pressed while in tab mode.- Liked the color options on this - it's matt finish and looks more expensive than it's price !Cons- Was very disappointed with the display, it's below average (extremely bad viewing angles, it's not an FHD screen)."
2097,B09CMMMV11,tab,"This for me was the biggest con - and  honestly i am even thinking of returning it just for this one issue, we need to keep changing the angles in sunlight while in tab mode to read a news paper/article.- May be i have not figured this one yet, but when in tab mode if it goes idle - it does not come back on unless bought into laptop mode.- Speakers are below average, they are loud - but not clear (again thy could do better at this price)
Pros :1."
2098,B09CMMMV11,tab,"Its good for students who do only classes...its just a big browser..like a big tab...but in this price its a good buy...again strictly would work excellent for students for online classes..
Amazing laptopBattery life once fully charged worked for the whole day.Touch is also good.Speakers are very good volume is loud and clear.Camera is ok ok.Keyboard is awesomeOver all best option in this range if you want both laptop and tablet."
2099,B09CMMMV11,tab,Battery life is best brightNess  also light weight very comfortable usage .
2100,B09CMMMV11,tab,But it\'s very cool to watch shows on this cutie and for reading books (in tab mode).

2282,B09H7G428M,keyboard,"I will upgrade the RAM on this to 16 (it\'s 8*1 now and I will add another equivalent 8 (3200/CL-22)) and see how it goes, but all that after I get the issue at hand sorted out.BTW, the reason I realized my keyboard had an issue late was because I use a Bluetooth keyboard and the only time I used its own keyboard was in its first day, and somehow I forgot to test the keyboard.FYI, it\'s a fingerprint magnet."
2283,B09H7G428M,keyboard,"REVIEW AFTER 10 DAYS OF USEI have been using this for last 10 days and this was awesome...got this after 2 days of order.PACKAGE:the packaging were good and they used some decent foam for support.BUILD QUALITY:the build quality was qutie good for this price range..it feels light enough for a gaming laptop..KEYBOARD/TRACKPAD:i really loved the keyboard and i really had good typing experience...for the trackpad it was good...and i mostly use external mouse...but the trackpad was fine..DISPLAY:the one downside is the display...i wont say it is the worst...but could be better...if u want to get better colour quality u can get a external monitor or get another system...but in this price range it is quite common..SPECS:for the specs its awesome...for around 60k u get a 6 core cpu 4600h wi=hich is amazing in long run..it has a dedicated gpu 1650 which is awesome..the ram is acceptable...quite common in this range...but can be easily upgraded to 16gb by adding a single 8gb stick..the m.2 ssd is nice gives a read speed of around 1700 which is awesome for laptops in this range..and also u can add additional hdd..i added a 512gb hdd and it works fine..PERFORMANCE:I installed premiere pro and photoshop and it was working perfect....i didnt overclock the system but i know it will do really good..i didnt try any games till now but will update in future but i am sure this can run most games in medium/high settings and get 60fps..TEMPS:for the temps it stays quite and in control while doing programming but can get little hot while doing some serious editing which is quite common..as it takes lots of cpu and gpu usage..OVERALL:i would definitely recommend this laptop.if u want a laptop for programming,editting,gaming this is the best choice for this price range...battery is average can get some 4hrs avg while using vs code and chrome...and 2-3 hours during editting..i would reccomend to upgrade the ram as soon as possible to get more perfomance outtaa this..if u want to get a more of a gaming laptop this is a OK choice as it has only 1650 and the display can hit u if u want good color precision...which can surely be eliminated by getting a good external display...i would give it a 8/10(as i didnt try any games on this deivce)will be updating more details after trying out new games and apps..make sure to give a thumbs up if u think this review helped u so that others can benefit from thisthanks :)

2284,B09H7G428M,keyboard,"I love the keyboard layout and key spacing, display is ok for development and gaming.Loudspeaker sound quality and voice clarity for skype calls is ok. By default almost 40 - 50% of RAM is used, bu i didn't affect the performance."
2285,B09H7G428M,keyboard,It feels better than using a external keyboard.The curve in the keys makes the typing experince for you perfect .2.I don't play any kind of games .The task I will be using this beast is for photoshop and illustrator.
2286,B09H7G428M,keyboard,The build quality and keyboard are some of the main difference in comparison to same range laptops.Without high ram usage it can easily last above 6 hrs of battery life.It's a beast in its price range.
2287,B09H7G428M,keyboard,There's little to no flex on the keyboard deck as well as the lid.
2288,B09H7G428M,keyboard,"The keyboard is also great to type, it is backlit and the arrow keys are full-sized and are a bit separated, so it might take you a couple of hours to get used to it.CONS: I am not really disappointed in anything as of yet but if I had to nitpick, speakers are pretty average, not bad but nothing special either, plus the battery life is around 5 hours while using the QUITE MODE for the thermals, which is decent for a gaming laptop but it might be a bummer for some.MISC: It has an extra RAM slot, the RAM installed is an 8GB DDR4 SODIMM one with a freq of 3200Hz."
2289,B09H7G428M,keyboard,This is one of the best gaming laptop under 63k.Also it is the best value for money laptop under this price bracket.Pros-1-The device is only taking less than 8 seconds to boot up.2-Powerful 6 core processor with a good gpu gives you the freedom to play almost all  games in medium to high settings smoothly.3-The keyboard backlighting is awesome.4-Also the thermals are pretty good.
2290,B09H7G428M,keyboard,"(User friendly interface, different performance modes,also other useful features).6-Also the built in keyboard is far better than i expected."
2291,B093VZC5X9,quality,"Worst build quality, the material used is low and laptop sucks when we type on the keyboardI will update my review after 6 months, after a close monitoring.Thank you."
2292,B093VZC5X9,quality,"Product is not that great1) The quality of the product is very bad... as it is very delicate, had to be handled with extra care ( Delicate Key board, looks like refurbished keyboard / Body too looks refurbished."
2293,B093VZC5X9,quality,"Value for moneyDelivery in one dayRunning very smoothGreat packingEasy setup ..completed in 15 minMore than enough for startup business
It is very frustrating to order from amazon, This is 3rd time I am receiving damaged order, It seems no quality check on the amazon side, Last time I booked a soundbar and it was a broken piece, this time I ordered a Laptop and touchpad is not working, Now there is no replacement available for this laptop, It will go for return after 5-6 days and then the amount will refund after 10 days something, This is not only blocking my money it is also disturbing my plan, Now I can't order another piece until my refund not processed as I had paid from amazon pay wallet."

2303,B093VZC5X9,quality,Comes with licensed win10 and as soon as u bootup asks for win11 upgrade.There are few things which I genuinely feel hp could have done better and that is keyboard quality (this one resembles just like ProBook but ProBook has much better quality...but again the ProBook screen is bad while this one's screen is good)Given the price range the overall feel n performance and the brand support u can expect down the lane is worth a deal(quality compromise on plastics used which I agree but it's not that bad and definitely not for gamers ).
2304,B093VZC5X9,quality,"Good configuration, performs well overall.Build quality needs to be better, screen brightness may be low for outdoor use.Warranty was pre-dated by about 3 weeks when I bought it and was a hassle to solve with HP and Amazon combined."
2305,B093VZC5X9,quality,"Laptop stopped working after appx 15days,  Seems faulty product has been delivered or quality is such like that it only will work until the period you can request replacement."
2306,B093VZC5X9,quality,"Now I have to keep chasing HP Service Center to get this repaired
I bought this laptop for my sister for studying purpose and this laptop does a good job.PROS:1) Screen comes with an ips display and colours are accurate, best for media consumption.2) Battery backup is good enough, upto 7-8 hours.3) Lightweight and easy to carry, 1.42kgs.4) Comes with pre-installed windows 10 home and ms office student version.5) Boot time is very fast, within 5 seconds.6) Average quality camera, good for video calling.7) Sound quality is good but not that loud.8) ram speed is 3200 which is quite decent.CONS:1) No gaming but what can you expect under this price range.Those were the only cons I found till now, if your budget is around 40k then go for it, you can even checkout realmebook which is around 37k with card offers in GIF sale, with card offers hp costs around 36k in GIF, hope this helps, have a great day."

2499,B098XLXDRS,battery,It's a brand new laptop and in 10 days the battery and motherboard is gone?
2500,B098XLXDRS,battery,The battery and motherboard needs to be replaced!
2501,B098XLXDRS,battery,Wow I can't understand how the battery and motherboard can have problems in just 10 days of purchase?
2502,B098XLXDRS,battery,( See Geekbench 5 score in screenshot)( The review by Shiv Tech Smart 2.0 youtube channel can be misleading probably because of a faulty product received by them).5)Not a gamer but still played Asphalt 9 on battery for 5 minutes and it handled it well though the temperature rose a little with a battery drain of 4% and cpu temperature reaching 40-45¬∞C .
2503,B098XLXDRS,battery,"No ""Fragile"" sticker is put on the package except the sticker talking about the ""Contains battery"" warning.A Great option for people who need a premium looking laptop."
2504,B098XLXDRS,battery,"Get the Ultra one if you can( bigger screen, bigger battery, higher refresh rate, heatsink over ssd) which is better value for money according to me."
2505,B098XLXDRS,battery,Disable digital video stabilization setting from camera app else there will be delay in video.Close to 10 hour battery backup after full charge.
2506,B098XLXDRS,battery,Battery is not for heavy use.... Additionally I didn't see any charging limiter so using while keeping on charge may degrade the battery.... Somehwat unlike other laptops...
2507,B098XLXDRS,battery,"\xa0received unit is faulty - fingerPrint, power button and battery are not working properlyIssue with the received unit:1. after using it for few hours the system got struck and made a noise and didn't work for a long time and then i force shut down it and opened it."
2508,B098XLXDRS,battery,the battery life shows very differently some times it gives 7hr and sometimes it's 2 hr even after the battery is fully charged(green light is indicated for full charge) for almost the same kind of workflow.3.
2509,B098XLXDRS,battery,"I was looking for one with a good display that will help me work without the monitor connected.2) Battery:With a moderate use, battery performance on the first day was really good."
2510,B098XLXDRS,battery,Build quality is awesome too.. battery life was decent for my working (around 7-8 hours) over all for 68k it was a steal deal for me..
2511,B098XLXDRS,battery,\xa0The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p  low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps .
2512,B098XLXDRS,battery,I\'d suggest 60Hz for slightly more battery though.Now onto battery.
2513,B098XLXDRS,battery,"Takes some time to charge from 80-100, I think it\'s to reduce the battery degradation over time, so it\'s a good thing."
2514,B098XLXDRS,battery,"Also youtubers suggest not to charge your laptops above 80-90% for the same reason so it is good.Now the usage I got for the entire 100% of battery, till the laptop shutdown by itself at 3.2k (native resolution) and 90Hz refresh was around 8 hours of screen time."
2515,B098XLXDRS,battery,"On same resolution and 60Hz I easily get 6 hours on just 80% battery(this is how I normally use the laptop, to stop battery degradation)The camera quality is better than most, and mic has a good capture range(no noise cancellation or anything so picks up your background easily).The headphone jack is good and it also letsnyou select headset/headphone.IT IS NOT A GAMING LAPTOP."
2516,B098XLXDRS,battery,"It has really nice precision touch driver suport for multi finger gestures which are handy to use.Final verdict: if you want an absolutely gorgeous display with light weight, sturdy, full aluminium build for productivity tasks or just college with entry level FPS gaming and good battery life this is the pick for you."
2517,B098XLXDRS,battery,"Must go for this
Superb build quality, awesome screen, and the main highlight of this laptop is its design, it feels very premium, battery backup is also very good i got 8 hours backup in normal usage and 6 hours in heavy usage."
2518,B098XLXDRS,battery,For the battery I get somewhere around 5-6 hrs.
2519,B098XLXDRS,battery,"For me Noo.Battery life - i setup and updated all updates and downloaded software and surfing while connected to wifi for 3.5 hrsThen transferred my old pc data to this still connted to wifi and meanwhile twerk some settings also for around 1hrAnd watched 2 movies in vlc player (skipping emotional scenes) for around 3.5hr and after these all laptop remain with 18% battery.So overall battery performance is more than sufficient for me 7-8 hrs in 30% brightness and used in one before better performance mode.I'm sure if you drain batteryfrom 100% to below 10% you can easily get 9-10hrs of browsing office work (word excel and all) or even programming with browser with 30% brightness.For brightness its good for in doors and i even don't have any problems in using outdoor so it depends on person.Overall OP OP LAPTOP üëëüî•
4.6/5 my ratingCons:1."
2520,B098XLXDRS,battery,Mso2019 & windows 11Great:Build qualityDisplaySpecifications at the price pointBattery life is 8hrs medium usage (+-2.5 for low and heavy usage) daylong battery.Performance with respect to price.
2521,B098XLXDRS,battery,SSD and processor make it supper fast and all their claims are right except battery.
2522,B098XLXDRS,battery,"If you are going to use it for online classes (video mode on), you will get only 5-6 hours of battery life."
2523,B098XLXDRS,battery,"Very slim, looks nice and professional but bulky

GOOD PRODUCT
It's Wonderful....

Not so happy with keyboard It feels like cheaper."
2534,B098XLXDRS,battery,"I kinda wish Xiaomi went with the 6-core i5 but given the bad thermals, that\'d prolly make things worse?Another aspect that suck for me, especially coming from a MacBook 13"", are the speakers and battery."

2536,B098XLXDRS,battery,I believe the crux of the issue is that Xiaomi added a pretty low capacity battery in a large laptop with a large screen.
2537,B098XLXDRS,battery,I wished the battery was a bit bigger to get 6-8 hours but maybe I\'m asking too much at this price point?The trackpad is trash.

The laptop has been proven to be a superior machine in terms of quality and performance despite a competitive price there has been some compromises to reduce the price such as absence of dedicated GPU, a card slotbut for a normal user like me it should not matter much so I'd give it a 4.5 stars a best buy itself, xiomi has created an ecosystem now and I've become a part of it

2633,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Pros:1) Build quality.2) Display (best I have ever seen amongst laptops).3) Keyboard, great typing experience.4) Fingerprint, lightening fast.Cons:1) Sound speakers downwards, would have been better on surface."
2634,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Unfortunately, I have never seen good speakers in mid range laptop."
2635,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Mac speakers are definitely good, but with a price tag.Overall: Value for money.Yet to test:1) Battery.2) Performance."
2636,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"SAD, I bought it under the impression I could buy mi extended warranty after purchase of the product :(
Excellent laptop for productivity purpose and watching movies( with external speakers üîä).Display is awesome and Laptop feels very premium."
2637,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Superb build quality.Trackpad is also good,Didn't check the games yet will update the review after one month of use.Programming purpose this is the best Laptop with good display.Booting is very fast and it will open the screen in 5sec with finger print access.Cons which I feel1.even though it is 15 inch lap it doesn't have number keys at right side of the keyboard.2.Volume of the speakers is very less for spending 77k.3."
2638,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"(fyi guys:-i bought the i5 16 gb variant)you also must go 16 gb if you want to use it for like more than 2 years.cons:-1.trackpad quality is little disappointing imean it's great,but it's just that it fells a little how can i say that luke mushy or something like that you have to get used to it.2.heat yup let me tell you heat issues are there like even if u have a 16 gb variant and u are running like just 3-4 applications  it will get like more warmer than usuall.like on the f2-f3 keys and above section.so yeah you can expect more heating while doing extensive tasks.like video rendering or slight gaming.3.i don't know if this happened with me only or it was a bug but while set up i was facing a white screen issue after logging in my microsoft account.i had to re-start the laptop like couple of times,then the setup got completed.4.speakers those damnnn speakers.bc mera phone jyada tez sound krta hai un speakers se.i would recommend to get a mini Bluetooth speaker for content consumption.i download a app called audio relay,so it let me use my phone's speaker as a wireless speaker.ohk so that was all form my side
No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price."
2639,B098XLXDRS,speakers,Now the only thing left is after sale service and how long this last before its first breakdown.Low sound in speakers can be fixed by selecting gaming mode in dts app coming preinstalled with the laptop.
2640,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"My last HP laptop with Dolby Advanced Audio was not even 30% of this, even with front firing speakers."
2641,B098XLXDRS,speakers,Very poor speakers: Those 2 2W speakers are very mediocre.
2642,B098XLXDRS,speakers,The speakers lack bass and treble and the volume output is very tiny.
2643,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"This is a real bummer, the thunderbolt port also doesny charge the laptop.The webcam and the speakers are also totally useless."
2644,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Hope it works for others.Happy with the build quality, display, wifi 6 and fast ports.Rest all is just gimick unless some miraculous software update can fix the speakers, webcam and charging options."
2645,B098XLXDRS,speakers,Haven't heard the cooling fans kicking in yet.512gb nvme ssd for speedy launch of programming ide like pycharm.16gb ram - most of the time 8 gb freeIntel iris graphics - haven't tried any games yet but 4k YouTube videos are smooth.Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1 for reliable connectivity.65w usb type c charger - full charge in 90 mins.Can use 65w mobile phone charger to charge this laptop.Fingerprint sensor and power button combined.Good loud speakers after enabling games mode on inbuilt dts app and turning on Equalizer.Lifetime validity Office 2019 included - get ready to work on excel Power point etc without spending additional for Microsoft office software.
2646,B098XLXDRS,speakers,But it seems there is an option in bios to keep it on the whole time once selected.Default sound output from speakers not loud enough.
2647,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"I worked for nearly 5 hours (out of which 2 hrs of zoom calls) and 50% drained.3) Camera:Camera is just fine for video calls, not bad actually as it's used mainly for video conferences or online classes etc.4) Speakers:Inbuilt speakers are fine for the above mentioned uses."
2648,B098XLXDRS,speakers,maybe 16 gb varient will give 60 to 90%.4) Charging while using it takes around 3 hours.5) speakers are a little bit low but i didn't faced any problem as i always use earphones or headphones.6) heating i didn't faced any major heating issue.I tried 4k video rendering and valorant but the temperature never exceeded 80¬∞C .
2649,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Everything is great except for inbuilt speakers, which produces very less sound, especially while using on bed."
2650,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"I wanted to test this laptop out of curiosity to introduce internally for our managers and consultants.PROS:Well designed Laptop with soft keyboard with backlit functionBrilliant 3K display unparalleled in its class and rangeWell packaged Specs under Rs.77,000 (Inclusive of taxes)Reasonable weight (though not light as LG Gram or Apple Air) considering its sturdy buildGreat aesthetics (Reminds you of Apple Macbook Pro)Good and quiet performance (Does not heat at all as it has great insulation and fan to vent out heat)Great performance for running office and many other applications.CONS:The touchpad should be as good as what's available in Apple Macbook ProOptions to buy with dedicated Graphic Card for UX/Graphics users.I strongly recommend this product for almost all purposes
Charger is of average quality and the speakers are not up to the merk honesty."
2651,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Till now i didn't find any unexpected issue from the if in future i will provide an update
Except for poor speakers everything else is awesome."
2652,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Very slim, looks nice and professional but bulky
Pros: great display, fast finger print scanner, nice build quality, aluminium body with nice design, good battery life.Cons: speakers are average, it can get scratches on body easily.you can play games on it but it gets heated."
2653,B098XLXDRS,speakers,Heating is managed well and fan kicks in on higher load.Camera and speakers are average.
2654,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Contrary to popular belief, I found speakers okay5."
2655,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"My model is i5 / 16GB Ram / 512 SSD
I like to say that its a perfect laptop for person who wants to use a premium product at a affordable price ....only thing I feel that definitely need to be improve is speakers and charging support with mobile charger
Everything is good but sound quality disappointed me!!"
2656,B098XLXDRS,speakers,Lastly speakers are not loud.
2657,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Core 17 16GB.Excellent Notebook...
Value for money product, laptop speakers are underpowered, build quality and configuration available is best for heavy to moderate usage, speakers are low in volume,needs improvement."
2658,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"Nice laptop at 56k ..16gb varient
Super product in the budget....if you go for same configuration in any other brand need to pay 40k extra... except speakers everything is great.... speakers are your basic need.... don't go for it...."
2659,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"I kinda wish Xiaomi went with the 6-core i5 but given the bad thermals, that\'d prolly make things worse?Another aspect that suck for me, especially coming from a MacBook 13"", are the speakers and battery."
2660,B098XLXDRS,speakers,It\'s big yet it sucks.The speakers are just terrible.
2661,B098XLXDRS,speakers,"I REALLY HOPE Xiaomi continues to iterate on these laptops, fix these flows:- Ditch Intel, give us AMD which will give more cores, better value- Improve the cooling- Better speakers- Better trackpad- Proper drivers/support website- Better BIOSThe Windows laptop space is long overdue for a revolution and I think Xiaomi is well-positioned to make big waves like they did with the Redmi/POCO series back in the days."
2662,B098XLXDRS,speakers,This laptop do everything and any type of work very smoothly and easily you can do it on this mi notebook ultra..Camera and speakers quality is slightly low but that does not countable.

No slim book with 16 GB ram, 3.2k display and an aluminum chassis at this price."
2666,B098XLXDRS,price,So for 64000 it is not that overpriced considering the import charges.
2667,B098XLXDRS,price,"no light in  worst experience from xiaomi .when you buy a product for 64k price you expect from that .. and in just three daysüò°üò°
I just received this laptop earlier today."
2668,B098XLXDRS,price,The 3K display at this price point is just nuts.
2669,B098XLXDRS,price,ProsGreat price to value proposition.
2670,B098XLXDRS,price,Value for money at this price range compared to other exclusive laptop brands .
2671,B098XLXDRS,price,"some times while opening the system the authentication will not ask for fingerPrint it directly opens, i thought it quickly recognized the fingerPrint as soon as it system opened but while restarting the system also observed the same issue.at last, the build quality, the screen, and the specs at this price point is great but you need to get a good working unit."
2672,B098XLXDRS,price,Pros:Great display..Great speed...Great metallic design...Great performance....Highly responsive fingerprint scanner..Typing feels marvelous..Battery backup satisfactorily upto 3hrs.. (we cannot expect much at this price range)Cons:Numeric keypad is absent.Speakers are down facing...
2673,B098XLXDRS,price,Hence you won't feel that much sound.Grill vents in the downside of the laptop are bendable which I quite personally hate so much.Overall:Wonderful product at this price range.
2674,B098XLXDRS,price,"I felt it's more effective when it's kept on a surface than we keep it on lap.5) Performance:Performance wise there is not much notable difference from those of others with the same specification3) Others:Fingerprint, keyboard, mouse pad are also impressive in the first instance.My take: Overall a good, worthy and budget friendly product when compared to those in the same category!Thanks to Amazon too, to deliver it quickly and to give an option to buy for a day when the stock is up
The laptop has been proven to be a superior machine in terms of quality and performance despite a competitive price there has been some compromises to reduce the price such as absence of dedicated GPU, a card slotbut for a normal user like me it should not matter much so I'd give it a 4.5 stars a best buy itself, xiomi has created an ecosystem now and I've become a part of it
I bought this on 8th Sep."
2675,B098XLXDRS,price,It is cheating as you pay the same price for curtailed benefits but you are not told of this upfront.
2676,B098XLXDRS,price,\xa0The laptop is extremely well builtI have i5 8gb variant as 16 gb was out of stock.1) performance is great for this price range is great2) battery life is also good for an instance i started at 9 in the morning at 100% and it lasted for 2 pm.In meanwhile i was continuously using it at 90hz 3 tabs were open in chrome and it was connected to wifi and Bluetooth display brightness was 50% as i was indoor.3) Gaming I don't do heavy gaming but i played valorant on it at 1080p  low graphics and it was giving around 50 to 80 fps .
2677,B098XLXDRS,price,"The Laptop is the best in the price range.Pros- Performance, Build Quality, Display, Battery, TrackpadCons- Keyboard a little Flimsy with a little flexThe sound problem can be resolved by playing with the DTS Control Panel."
2678,B098XLXDRS,price,"Even though it has a price tag of 64k, it is definitely worth the buy."
2679,B098XLXDRS,price,"\xa0The screen display is top notch, unbeatable at this price range."

2684,B098XLXDRS,price,Excellent price rangeNegatives:1.
2685,B098XLXDRS,price,"However, I found nothing wrong with the product so far.Summary:Excellent laptop for office use at resonable price (havent tried games at all)

Liked it, good battery and brightness
GOOD PRODUCT
It's Wonderful....
Over priced....and some accessories should be included along with laptop such as pen drive or alexa
It's a good product"", 'I got some 3rd party charger which is lte and other than that it is really a good product worth it
Not so happy with keyboard It feels like cheaper."
2691,B098XLXDRS,price,Really liked the laptop....worth the price and brilliant build quality.
2692,B098XLXDRS,price,But it\'s no productivity champ either with just 4 measly cores Intel decided to add at this price point.
2693,B098XLXDRS,price,I wished the battery was a bit bigger to get 6-8 hours but maybe I\'m asking too much at this price point?The trackpad is trash.
2694,B098XLXDRS,price,"The fingerprint reader doesn\'t work, there are no Linux drivers for it as of now.Verdict:---------I want to applaud Xiaomi even though this laptop has some big red marks, because I think at this price point, you\'ll find it hard to get a laptop that\'s tailored for productivity/day-to-day office work with such a good display."
2695,B098XLXDRS,price,"It\'s a daylight robbery what HP/Dell/Lenovo is doing, pushing subpar laptops at this price point when Xiaomi here is able to make a point that you can indeed provide great bang-for-the-buck laptops."
2696,B098XLXDRS,price,I highly recommed this laptop to you because it is very difficult to find a laptop with this much specs at this resonable price.I bought this laptop in Rs53000 because amazon gives so much discount for this product.
2697,B098XLXDRS,price,"Of course we are purchasing this laptop for productive work not for clicking selfie's üòÖ.Now a days almost every people have smartphone with high resolution cemera and best quality speakers.Bunch of specifications this laptop have...like3.2k Display, WiFi 6, light weight easy to carry, battery back up uoto 10 hours, Irix graphics card, 89.2 screen to display ration ..and many moreSo over all this laptop is value for money product people can definitely look for this, in this price rang people might not be able to found other product with this type of specifications."

2989,B098QBT5KT,screen,"Will try out few titles and update my review from Gaming perspectiveNow to the not so fun part.As many have pointed out in the review of the GTX 1650, the wobbling of the screen is noticeable but haven't interfered with my usage."
2990,B098QBT5KT,screen,"If you are a pro gamer, better to go with other brands with RTX 3xxx and above GPU with 144 Hz and above screen refresh rate
I'm writing this review after using it for 8days."
2991,B098QBT5KT,screen,""", ""I bought it for 59kfirst I clear doubts about specifications of laptop1.screen is 60hz and 63-68 % srgbit is good display for normal gaming.2.adafter provided is 150 w (200w is for higher variants)3.keboard light brightness is not adjustable."
2992,B098QBT5KT,screen,")9.it is made of  plastic body.10.cpu tgp 45w gpu 85w.As from utube sources and benchmarks r5 5600h is approximately equal to i7 10 th gen. And gpu rx5500m lies between 1660 and 1660 ti.for normal usage temperature is below  55(for coading, browsing, multitasking) but it again depends on surrounding temperature .keyboard and track pad is good.As  utube reviewers said there in no much screen wobble it is fine(until unless u disturb it, it won't wobble."
2993,B098QBT5KT,screen,battery backup is not  that much good as  it has 70 whr battery maybe because of large screen.Brightness also fine.
2994,B098QBT5KT,screen,The screen wobbles but hasn't been an issue to me.
2995,B098QBT5KT,graphics,Not many gaming laptop have this and is very usefulThe integrated GPU have 512 MB DDR4 dedicated memory and the dedicated graphics card have 4GB GDDR6 RAM which should be able to handle most of the AAA games.
2996,B098QBT5KT,graphics,Good thing is the entire 8 GB is in single slot allowing you to add additional 16 GB RAM in the empty slotThe unknown factsHave read reviews in the GTX 1650 model that the dedicated graphics is used all the time and there's not setting to disable and use the integrated GPU [to save battery while not gaming].
2997,B098QBT5KT,graphics,"My usage of the last 8 hours, only my integrated graphics was used and the dedicated graphics is idle."
2998,B098QBT5KT,graphics,"Everything is fine except a small backlight problem in one corner of displayAnd Good performance but fps is decreases while playing game for about 5 minutes .. To fix this it needs a sleep on and off then good stable fps..
Its good for its price range....wobbling was not that much of an issue...it's a 4 way air flow unlike told on the product features when we are scrolling....dedicted graphics card won't run untill we give some load,thinking about it it's better..overall good
Ryzen 5 5600H is best under 60k but don't update into windows 11 now
Don't fall in trap just looking at price."
2999,B08T6SJ215,quality,"it did take lot of time to boot initially, but now boots up fine....Havent faced any sound or heat issues yet.Screen output quality could have been better..... to get the optimum brightness you have to raise the brightness to almost the limit.Sound output is not that great.....so far so good."
3000,B08T6SJ215,quality,"Looks premium, built quality is also good and also fast."
3001,B08T6SJ215,quality,Sound quality is the another killer.
3002,B08T6SJ215,quality,"Absolutely appalled by this service & I can't believe a new product paid for in full was delivered in this condition
Pros:Display quality.Light weight.Decent sound.Good performance as per it's hardware.Cons:One main thing is it's GPU is shared memory not dedicated."
3003,B08T6SJ215,quality,"Looks good üôÇüòä
Product is low quality.within 3 days use the monitor gone blank."
3004,B08T6SJ215,quality,Also when use with internet it makes a lot of noise.Booting is pathetic and takes minimum 4 to 5 minutes.After paying so much amount and getting such quality is really bad.Would never recommend any of my friends or relatives to buy this anymore.Now waiting for hp to provide resolution.It is 4 th day but till date no update from HP.Amazon pls do not sell such low quality product at your site.
3005,B08T6SJ215,quality,Laptop is more or less fast with good screen quality.
3006,B08T6SJ215,quality,"Be it Windows 10, MS office life time, HD camera, High resolution display, 8 Gb ram, 1Tb HDD, High quality stereo speakers with good volume.Not tried yet for heavy games like PUBG, CS, ASPHALT etc..
Never ever go for this product."
3007,B08T6SJ215,quality,"For name sake they have said 8GB, but the time it takes to refresh n open n response its lagging... Those 4 stars is only for look n packing n build quality."
3008,B08T6SJ215,quality,"Likes:1) Display2) Looks3) Brand value and reliability and number of service centersDislikes:1) Poor battery quality (2hrs for charging and 1.5 hrs for discharging2) Slow processor (it takes 5-10 mins to start, however after it gets started, overall performance is OK for this price, not fast as i3, not laggy as Celerion or Athlon

3606,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"During black screen, you can clearly see white light seeping in from the light source on the edges of the screen."
3607,B09G6VPW6W,screen,Touch screen works amazing though!
3608,B09G6VPW6W,screen,I particularly buy touch screen laptops as it makes for an amazing web browsing experience with one of my hand on the screen ready to scroll through content lot faster than track pad.
3609,B09G6VPW6W,screen,Even single clicks on OK and Agree are lot faster to tap on screen than move the cursor.3.
3610,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"Awesome laptop, the screen quality is great, performance is awesome, don't go by the i3 moniker, has an all mettalic body, touchpad is large, the fingerprint scanner is fast, speakers are okay, battery backup is good, the SSD is super fast, boots in about 6 seconds, has 2 USB  Type A ports, one USB Type C port, one HDMI port, a 3.5 mm jack (headphone and microphone), an SD card slot and a barrel connector."
3611,B09G6VPW6W,screen,The touchscreen works pretty well.
3612,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"If you need a nice screen increase your budget, but this is average for the price, still good but not the best you can get for the price."
3613,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"And remember the touch screen is not that useful in day to day life unless you're drawing something or you're into reading a lot and arts, if this is not you go for a standard laptop not 2 in 1.So, a solid 7/10.For Gaming- A big NO, if you want to game this is the worst decision you would make, first of all i3 which is a good processor for day to day activities like chrome and work with word and other microsoft office tools, but that also if pushed to limits it'll start becoming slow, so, if you like to open up 10-15 tabs at once and do 4-5 projects at once this won't be your best choice, now if the laptop can't handle that it certainly cannot handle gaming ofcourse it can handle some small games but mostly nothing from the epic store so, if gaming is the main purpose look for i5 and non touch screen laptops."
3614,B09G6VPW6W,screen,Physical damage near the borders of the screen.Thanks to Amazon for their excellent customer care support.
3615,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"Gets extremely hot within a few secs of turning it on..n way too heavy..also there is some screen damage or lighting issue at the top edge..I‚Äôve seen similar reviews..didn‚Äôt know it was just 7 days return period..missed it..just ensure a thorough check is done cos looks like Amazon is selling some not so good hp laptops
The media could not be loaded."
3616,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"The laptop had major display issues after which I opted for replacement.The replacement was delivered on June 23, and after drivers update, worked fine apart from the battery issue.However, within a week, the screen started flickering badly when using on tablet mode (ss attached), and the battery performance on meetings was dismal (around 2-3 hours only).Amazon denied replacing the product again, and now I am stuck with the defected laptop with screen and battery issues, hoping for HP Warranty to come to my rescue."
3617,B09G6VPW6W,screen,Best touch screen operation in this laptop.
3618,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"if you are a coder , gamer , student you should prefer for graphic card in the same budget in acer or asus as the touchscreen is of no use...else you can prefer for acer aspire which has a 15.6 inch screen size as well as graphics card of nvida..though after 15 days of usage the product is working good and has no issues you can go for it as i have used it at a high end for programming."
3619,B09G6VPW6W,screen,Touch screen feature is the highlight .
3620,B09G6VPW6W,screen,In my case screen hinges are loose and the screen corners are making a tuck sound while pressing a little.Bottom vent heats up significantly making it unusable on lap.
3621,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"I got it at 18% discount rate .No other laptop can be compared with this laptop (512 gb ssd , touchscreen,8 gb ram , 11 th generation i-3 , backlit keyboard and 360  degree rotation )at this price range ( I bought it under 54 K on 3 rd June ,2021).I used hp laptop for the past 6 years."
3622,B09G6VPW6W,screen,After 20 days web cam is not working getting heatup and laptop screen damaged by technical engineer he came for web cam repair very bad experience with this product now they are not ready to replacement.
3623,B09G6VPW6W,screen,Productivity has increased after an upgrade.It will be nice if it detects the orientation and changes automatically.The most pointer gets stuck at times when you use both touchpad and the screen alternatively.
3624,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"\xa0Best laptop in this budget.. go for it blindly
I received laptop and opeing i sometimes get screen blur.The alexa inbuilt in not working.The system is slow and sometimes stopsI get error some times opening the application."
3625,B09G6VPW6W,screen,"Touch screen is very smooth and the sound as well is complete worth for the money paid
One problem only, the battery drains very fast."

3732,B096KWK1DB,quality,"well i must say this beast was more than i expected....i got it in 69990 in Diwali festival offers...but i would say i must recommended ...i checked..so far no issues are there...if you are taking this for gaming...i prefer you to take i7 ...i5 works well though...and the laptop is awesomeüî•üî•üî•...built quality, working and all.....go for it without without a thought...also i thought that this would be a defective piece...but i checked everything...there is nothing wrong...and This si complete budget gaming laptop if you want to buy!!!!!"

Satisfied
Worst product ever don't buy this audio quality is to low and brightness is also not  good and pperformance and quality is not good worst service provide to Prime  member  by Amazone team

The media could not be loaded."
3735,B096KWK1DB,quality,Build quality is great.
3736,B094XL5V92,battery,Most of the buying public would want to go for the 60Hz screen as it is a fantastic screen that wouldn\'t burden the small battery that the Legion comes with.The Keyboard:Pretty fantastic actually.
3737,B094XL5V92,battery,"The ""HF"" model doesnt have Intel\'s on board graphics processing unit and so you cannot enable ""Hybrid Mode""(when you arent running games or heavy graphics intensive apps the systems runs of Intels UHD graphics and saves a ton of battery.)"
3738,B094XL5V92,battery,"If you get the 81SY00SNIN your battery will run out much faster.Lenovo Vantage software not only lets you run Hybrid Mode and save battery, it has a Conservation Mode that only lets your battery charge to 60% while plugged in."
3739,B094XL5V92,battery,This reduced the impact on the battery per charge cycle and lets your battery last much longer.The smaller battery(52Wh) lasts for about 4 - 5 hour during standard use.
3740,B094XL5V92,battery,Good battery.
3741,B094XL5V92,battery,Battery backup 3 to 5 hrs depending on battery saver and screen brightness.
3742,B094XL5V92,battery,"First of if you want a prolonged battery life,dont buy it.This is beast of a gaming laptop,1650gtx+256ssd-i5-9th is all you could as for at 60-70k price range.But the battery life is too short,for example:if you want to even watch a movie of 2.5 hours it would drain from 100% to 25%.I have played games pretty much and put it on charge in mere 40 minutes.You need to undervolt the cpu voltage,use intel's undervolting software if it starts heating.No it wont effect performanceand enhance battery life abit.All in allGaming:9/10Battery:6/10Build quality:9/10 (think of it like a plastic war tank)Looks:10/10Screen:8/10 (60hz)Bought on October 6th 2019 for 67k

3750,B094XL5V92,battery,The only downside is the battery life which is pretty poor.
3751,B094XL5V92,gaming,It really isnt that heavy at 2.3kgs and it can definitely be your long-term workhorse.A few things:The Screen:There is an option to go for the 140Hz screen but that would only be for extreme gaming use or if you worked extensively with color(especially color correction).
3752,B094XL5V92,gaming,If you are gaming make sure you are plugged in.RAM and RAM Slots:The onboard ram is 2666Mhz 8GB.
3753,B094XL5V92,gaming,Can double up for office use and a bit side gaming.

Worth to buy
For professionals
I was apprehensive about buying a relatively new brand in laptops and after extensive research , i decided to take the plunge .I am super happy  with it for the following reasons1) small, sleek and really light2) High end configuration3) Superb battery life, lasts almost 3 days with my typical usage4) very quick start up5) Good VFM considering the competition
I bought this laptop a couple of months back, not from amazon though."
3846,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,No lifetime Microsoft office.No in built camera.No backlit keyboard.Track pad is cheap in construction.No carrying bag provided.Type c port doesn't change notebook.Provided charger is heavy on weight.The list goes on...
3847,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,Keys on the keyboard don\'t offer any resistance.
3848,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Some of them mentioned about the lack of an in-built camera, the notebook getting hot during gaming & the processor\'s thermal throttling kicking in, its RAM being not upgradable, its touch-pad being little mushy to operate, lack of a back-lit keyboard etc."
3849,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Moreover, I am a touch-typist who doesn\'t need to look at the keyboard while typing."
3850,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery."
3851,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"So, a back-lit keyboard was not a priority for me.Secondly, I am not a gamer, and even if I were, I would deploy a proper gaming rig for the purpose, and certainly not a 14"" portable notebook."
3852,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"The left and right mouse buttons aren\'t demarcated on the surface of the TouchPad, which assumes the shape of a single rectangular area below the keyboard."
3853,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"The keyboard is neatly laid out, and is very comfortable to touch type at full speed.Coming to the screen, the display is indeed an eye-candy."
3854,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"I am also glad to see that despite its size and weight, the notebook has plenty of ports including a Type-C port for data transfer and charging, an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack.but there is missing from the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is a microSD card slot and Thunderbolt 3 supportDidplay is also too good..in speaker there is no too much voice but good not bestkeyboard is good for me but if u need backlight , backlight is not therei love the performance of laptop just take few sec to openit's barvo..and the weight of laptops extremely lightthat's why i also like it..for me there is only one problem that is speaker."
3855,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,It doesn't have a backlit keyboard.
3856,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"I and my friend decided to buy Xiaomi laptop, We both are having issues with the laptop‚úì Low-quality Components, Heating issue, Suddenly Touchpad Stops Working, Keyboard Stuck while working‚úì Sound of my iPhone XR is more than this laptop ( CHEAP SPEAKER IN LAPTOP)‚úì battery backup is just 4 hours but Xiaomi claim 10 hours of battery, my 5 years old MacBook air has a better battery backup‚úì keyboard feels itself  like cheap quality keys‚úì laptop comes with old age charger ( never seen in notebooks )I don't feel there is anything special to pay a huge amount of 60,000I'm unable to do work on this laptop because of many issuesI lost my money, I'm thinking to sell it out and buy new ASUS laptop
Guys please buy this only if you can work on only day time."
3857,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,You can‚Äôt work in night no backlight for keyboard and this is productivity laptop ha ha .2.
3858,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"This laptop deserves all the Five Stars.The Spec that MI has offered is Amazing while keeping the price almost half to their rivals for Lappy with similar specs.It seems to be silly that the list of cons posted by others like no inbuilt camera, trackpad and keyboard."
3859,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,Nowhere MI has claimed that they have a backlight on the keyboard & there is a camera in built.
3860,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,After one month of usage the laptop is giving notifications that the Windows license has expired.The keyboard of the laptop and the key travel is a mess.
3861,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,It‚Äôs in the middle of the apple an HP keyboard.
3862,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"i bought this product thinking that it has a i7 10th Gen processor but seems like it is useless as other hardware is pathetic.I try to load a game and it restarting every time when I try to run the game.after some time use its mouse pad stopped working.Really a big disappointment
Combine macbook pro & dell XPS 13 and voila you got your self a mi notebook 14 horizon.Although I didn't received webcam bundled in box probably got dropped while shipping raised concern about it they didn't provided me another thats why giving it 4 stars other wise everything is great listed down some pros & consPros :1.Light weight smaller form factor2.Premium look & fill3.Powerful enough to to handle day to day task4.Doesn't heat up5.Bezzel less display looks great6.Charging speed is fast with bundled chargerCons :1.No backlight keyboard2.No room for upgradation eccept SSD3.Display brightness fills lacking while watching content
I bought this product just 10 days back and sparingly used."
3863,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Xiaomi is good for phone not for leptop
I have purchased this laptop 16 days back and I think this is the good time to write the review.Basically I am developer and purchased this laptop for development purpose.Performance 5/5Look 5/5Battery life 6-8 hours based on type of work you are doingScreen quality very good.Keyboard is very poor small keys and you have to spend good time to get used to of keyboard.Trackpad is not that much bad which I have seen in reviews.Sound quality is very poor.If you want to do tough work or gaming don‚Äôt go for this laptop."
3864,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"It's played very smoothly.You Can Charge your mobile when your Laptop Off.Price and Performance is better.Cons:It's very Sad news to all , you Can not Upgrade its RAM.Battery backup Stand by 14hr.RJ45 (LAN) is not available.Back lid not available for keyboard.Type Only for Data Transfer."
3865,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,1st :- bought new laptop of 60000k in 2021 no keyboard lights and no webcam.
3866,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"It is a good laptop for students, office work and u can do little bit gaming but while gaming the laptop will get toooo much heated for that u should use coolpad.be care full with keyboard they are very fragile."
3867,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Can play gta 5 on high graphics with no issue Only downside is no backlit keyboard and no inbuilt Webcam, however the USB camera provided has good picture quality."
3868,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Best performance laptop at this price range... good battery life and smooth as any thing..just one more addition would have made it unbeatable...backlit keyboard... but still satisfied with the laptop....
Good configuration."
3869,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"This is an extraordinary product, awesome performance, disadvantage was backlit keyboard..."
3870,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,No backlit keyboard.
3871,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,Only cons are no keyboard backlight.
3872,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"All features is good except for the speaker sound.its very less.u need to have additional speaker fitted if u want to enjoy the songs
2 cons:Trackpad makes filmsy soundNo keyboard lightTip: Change DTS settings to improve built in speaker performance
Excellent fast light-weight laptop."
3873,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"No finger printNo backlit keyboard,No in built cam,No lifetime Microsoft office.nofor gaming
It's barely been a month since I got the laptop and I turned it on to work one morning and got a BSOD."
3874,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"It dhould have better camera... camera is not  mony worthyBattery üîã is goodScreenquality is also fine
Overall product is good but I would have liked it more if it was having a backlit keyboard and there is a need to make the cursor-pad better."
3875,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Addional 8 gb ram and backlit keyboard can make it great
Absolute perfect in this price range
I don't want to talk about gamingBattery life was goodCamera 720 resolution good enough!"
3876,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"nice in budget but not buy this
Laptop gets hot like a ironbox
Nice light quality , performer
one of the best laptop in performance
Only concern is keyboard backlite ,
Over all everything is good.. only con is the backlit keyboard
Defective product delivered twice!"
3877,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,The only let down is the absence of backlit keyboard.
3878,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"This may not happen when you are just Normally using your laptop...Cons :-Keyboard : Its doesn't have a backlit keyboard, but I think you don't need a backlit keyboard if you have a very bright screen."
3879,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"if also the brightness is at 1 the whole room brightens up.If you want the focus to be at the keyboard then just tilt your screen ...Cover : I am not able to find a cover for the screen and touch pad, And also I'm not able to find a back cover or sticker of its size...Touch pad : It is a little bit small."
3880,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"It‚Äôs got an aluminum build, an extremely comfortable keyboard, latest Intel processors, and a screen with the thinnest bezels in the market."
3881,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"The Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition doesn‚Äôt cost as much as some of its rivals, but still offers excellent performance in a thin and light package.Pros:- 14-inch FHD Anti-glare display with minimal bezels- Intel Core i7 (10th generation)- 512GB NVMe SSD- Nvidia GeForce MX350- 1.35kg- Up to 10 hours of battery (practically lasts somewhere around 6-8 hours depending on your work)- Premium looks- Well priced (I won't call agressive pricing though)- Beautiful scissor-style keyboard with 1.3mm key travelCons:- No backlit keyboard in 2020 is a crime- Lack of a built-in webcam."
3882,B089DFJHZ8,keyboard,"Plus, they lack bassThe laptop has a good design, better processing power and keyboard than every other Windows laptop in this price bracket."
3883,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery."
3884,B089DFJHZ8,battery,By using heavier softwares battery drained in 5-6hrs.
3885,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"Overall battery and performance is good.If you are expecting free windows office, better go for lenovo as the version provided is trail and last only 1 month.Keyboard is okay not perfect.You will be boltware softwares which are pre loaded .Buy this laptop with little expectations and keep in mind this is budget laptop."
3886,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"Use earphone while playing games.Coming to battery, so if you are not gaming then it is amazingly high performing battery."
3887,B089DFJHZ8,battery,Because it drains the battery quickly during gaming.
3888,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"And obviously it will drain, it is only a 14 inch laptop and having very small space and one fan which runs high during gaming so battery drains in high rate.Will update more after 1 month.Update after 7 months."
3889,B089DFJHZ8,battery,Really amazing battery life and I almost never close my laptop just make it in log off mode.
3890,B089DFJHZ8,battery,Only the battery performance went down a bit.
3891,B089DFJHZ8,battery,When it was new it used to give almost 8.30 hour to 8 hour of battery performance.
3892,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"Also its doing great for editing.Except its made in China, I didn't found any issue.Also some people complain about heating but believe me it doesn't heating during my work.Ya might be possible during hard gaming it might get heated.Its battery backup is about 7 to 8 hrs of internet uses for my use.My recommendation is that those who need a laptop for working as a student or employee they should definitely go for it with the price of 60k.Otherwise there is many other options ."
3893,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"I and my friend decided to buy Xiaomi laptop, We both are having issues with the laptop‚úì Low-quality Components, Heating issue, Suddenly Touchpad Stops Working, Keyboard Stuck while working‚úì Sound of my iPhone XR is more than this laptop ( CHEAP SPEAKER IN LAPTOP)‚úì battery backup is just 4 hours but Xiaomi claim 10 hours of battery, my 5 years old MacBook air has a better battery backup‚úì keyboard feels itself  like cheap quality keys‚úì laptop comes with old age charger ( never seen in notebooks )I don't feel there is anything special to pay a huge amount of 60,000I'm unable to do work on this laptop because of many issuesI lost my money, I'm thinking to sell it out and buy new ASUS laptop
Guys please buy this only if you can work on only day time."
3894,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"As the laptop is light and thin, the battery backup (5 to 6 hours is what I get for moderate use)  is a little less than the rivals offerings."
3895,B089DFJHZ8,battery,"great laptop if you get it under 60k , comes with a bundled camera which is of average quality and delivers 720p of video, display of this device us a huge plus point , i loved its almost bezel less approach and nice srgb coverage.second thing, the battery is long long long lasting , in my case it lasted approx 9hr since i watched complete DARK season one in the single charge .cons:the only con i found that its trackpad makes a clicky sound which make it feel like the cheap quality one.but apart from that wierd sound it is functioning very wellpeople who are looking for a sleek , powerful or long lasting laptop should go for it , do not think of gaming one if your conditions matches with those above mentioned

3896,B089DFJHZ8,battery,It charges faster than my mobile Phone .No heating while charging.Don't think about its battery life you don't need to look at its battery in whole day .
3897,B089DFJHZ8,battery,\xa0This product waste of money audio quality is poor .. and battery life is very poor i am very disappointed of this product.

3918,B089DFJHZ8,camera,Web camera should be in built.

3935,B089DFJHZ8,camera,"Can play gta 5 on high graphics with no issue Only downside is no backlit keyboard and no inbuilt Webcam, however the USB camera provided has good picture quality."
3936,B089DFJHZ8,camera,Not having builtin camera isnt a big issue for us!
3937,B089DFJHZ8,camera,However what has left a bad and lasting impression was that I had to purchase the camera separately when it was supposed to come free.
3938,B089DFJHZ8,camera,"The camera is not that great
Best thing about this laptop is the built quality and performanceOnly dislike is the camera , it should be in the laptop
Extremely light and thin laptop."
3939,B089DFJHZ8,camera,"Many other laptops are there with good built-in quality and in less budget
Actually I did not need a camera on this laptop so the external camera should have been optional which is an additional 1000 I would have saved."
3940,B089DFJHZ8,camera,It came and it's speakers are terrible it's display is terrible and camera is terrible it has decent.
3941,B089DFJHZ8,camera,"Just go for a better laptop like lg gram or lenovo  idapad slim 5  just terrible
Mi notebook horizon edition worth for money.. i7 10 gen, but thy could have given integrated camera, no windows word pre installed, and key board lights missing."
3942,B089DFJHZ8,camera,"It dhould have better camera... camera is not  mony worthyBattery üîã is goodScreenquality is also fine

Excellent performance & every businessmen  will love it for sure
I kinda like it
Very poor quality screen
Good construction , smooth interface but camera is worst
Good laptop
The performance is way beyond my expectations."
3947,B089DFJHZ8,camera,But it is justifiable as if they give a larger touch pad then they would have to make the laptop much bigger and the bezels would have been larger...Student : If you are a student who have to keep their camera ON all the time then it would be a Difficulty to carry the camera...
3948,B089DFJHZ8,camera,"If you don't have to keep your camera On all the time then it is best for you... And also without inbuilt camera we get PRIVACY, In the era of Cyber attacks PRIVACY is very important, this makes sure that you don't loose your privacy...AT THE MOST LAST : this is your choice that which Laptop, who are we to tell you that which one to buy which one to not..."
3949,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,Volume is also bit okay as its a notebook.

3951,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"(Although I don\'t care since I use an external mouse anyway)
Before purchase, I went through several reviews of MI Horizon 14"" notebook."
3952,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Some of them mentioned about the lack of an in-built camera, the notebook getting hot during gaming & the processor\'s thermal throttling kicking in, its RAM being not upgradable, its touch-pad being little mushy to operate, lack of a back-lit keyboard etc."
3953,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"I also noticed that even the rating system of Amazon India requires the customers to rate a notebook based on the quality of the in-built camera, and as to whether the notebook could be used for gaming."
3954,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"But then, I had my reasons when I went ahead, and bought the Core i7 version of the MI Horizon 14"" notebook.I believe that while buying a notebook, one has to be clear about the purpose."
3955,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,Style comes close second as a priority.My use for the notebook is for office document creation.
3956,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"In addition, a back-lit keyboard would be a drain on the notebook battery."
3957,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"So, a back-lit keyboard was not a priority for me.Secondly, I am not a gamer, and even if I were, I would deploy a proper gaming rig for the purpose, and certainly not a 14"" portable notebook."
3958,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"So considerations of gaming did not affect my notebook purchase.I prefer using a Logitech Full HD webcam for video-conferencing, as it has been my observation that webcams built into the notebooks usually have poor optical performance."
3959,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Xiaomi \'s own survey had shown that a webcam is not a priority for most notebook users, but this was before the COVID-19 pandemic (You see, the Chinese did not see the pandemic coming!"
3960,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"üòú).As to the RAM being soldered on to the motherboard, many brands are doing this to reduce the thickness of the notebook."
3961,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Providing RAM connectors on the motherboard not only adds to the thickness of the notebook, but also adds potential failure points."
3962,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,Removing RAM connectors from the motherboard and directly soldering the RAM on to the motherboard shaves off some cost that could be deployed elsewhere during notebook design.
3963,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Besides, 8 GB of RAM is abundant for my requirement, and when the need for upgrade comes, it will be of the notebook and not of the RAM."
3964,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Therefore, soldered RAM was not my concern!The design emphasis in MI Horizon 14"" notebook is on minimalism."
3965,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,There aren\'t a plethora of blinking LED lights as one would notice in some Fujitsu notebooks.
3966,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"The bezels of the screen are super-slim, and the notebook\'s lid can be opened with a single finger.The TouchPad is also minimalistic."
3967,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,It is far above in quality compared to several other notebooks which boast of a Full HD screen.
3968,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"I would only say that I could effortlessly edit the RAW imagery from my Sony Alpha camera, thanks to the bright display.Overall, a stylish all rounder notebook, provided you are aligned with its design philosophy!"
3969,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Good design build quality super Mi laptop supports direct casting also need to choose Nvidia graphics  by default graphics set to UHD graphics and also need to set custom audio sounds For better audio output choose user and then enable all Encahces modes along with traditional mode settingsCons :1.No backlight2.Ram expand not possible as soldered to mother board3.touch pad is slight need to improve4.No HDD slot and only 2gb graphic card5.Speakers are located bottom if it was on top  it might good
in notebook horizon  I love the sturdy aluminum unibody chassis."
3970,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Weighing at just 1.35 kg, the notebook is slim and extremely light."
3971,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"I am also glad to see that despite its size and weight, the notebook has plenty of ports including a Type-C port for data transfer and charging, an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB 3.1 ports, a USB 2.0 port, and a headphone jack.but there is missing from the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is a microSD card slot and Thunderbolt 3 supportDidplay is also too good..in speaker there is no too much voice but good not bestkeyboard is good for me but if u need backlight , backlight is not therei love the performance of laptop just take few sec to openit's barvo..and the weight of laptops extremely lightthat's why i also like it..for me there is only one problem that is speaker."
3972,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"I and my friend decided to buy Xiaomi laptop, We both are having issues with the laptop‚úì Low-quality Components, Heating issue, Suddenly Touchpad Stops Working, Keyboard Stuck while working‚úì Sound of my iPhone XR is more than this laptop ( CHEAP SPEAKER IN LAPTOP)‚úì battery backup is just 4 hours but Xiaomi claim 10 hours of battery, my 5 years old MacBook air has a better battery backup‚úì keyboard feels itself  like cheap quality keys‚úì laptop comes with old age charger ( never seen in notebooks )I don't feel there is anything special to pay a huge amount of 60,000I'm unable to do work on this laptop because of many issuesI lost my money, I'm thinking to sell it out and buy new ASUS laptop
Guys please buy this only if you can work on only day time."
3973,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,notebook build quality expected good.4.
3974,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Excellent notebook, no second question on that front."
3975,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"i bought this product thinking that it has a i7 10th Gen processor but seems like it is useless as other hardware is pathetic.I try to load a game and it restarting every time when I try to run the game.after some time use its mouse pad stopped working.Really a big disappointment
Combine macbook pro & dell XPS 13 and voila you got your self a mi notebook 14 horizon.Although I didn't received webcam bundled in box probably got dropped while shipping raised concern about it they didn't provided me another thats why giving it 4 stars other wise everything is great listed down some pros & consPros :1.Light weight smaller form factor2.Premium look & fill3.Powerful enough to to handle day to day task4.Doesn't heat up5.Bezzel less display looks great6.Charging speed is fast with bundled chargerCons :1.No backlight keyboard2.No room for upgradation eccept SSD3.Display brightness fills lacking while watching content
I bought this product just 10 days back and sparingly used."
3976,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Mi notebook 14 Horizontal addition, which was a good laptop at a price segment of 60k."

If you buy any hp/asus/apple/microsoft you can get anywhere service and all parts are available in local markets but in this case my display damaged and only through service center the replacement done with Rs.12211/- I feel sorry for this
I bought this MI notebook horizon I7 3 weeks before and the performance is good."
3978,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,Amazing notebook.
3979,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,"Just go for a better laptop like lg gram or lenovo  idapad slim 5  just terrible
Mi notebook horizon edition worth for money.. i7 10 gen, but thy could have given integrated camera, no windows word pre installed, and key board lights missing."
3980,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,I read it in specifications as Windows is included but it is asking to activate windows nowWith in 15 days after buying notebook mother board gone and service Center people ordered the same.
3981,B089DFJHZ8,notebook,Sure Xiaomi does provide a USB-enabled HD webcam in the box with the laptop but it's not the something one would like after paying this much- The notebook also lacks a physical fingerprint scanner as well which is again a bummer for the price and this time and age- The biggest downside of the Mi Notebook 14 Horizon Edition is that there is no way to expand the notebook‚Äôs 8GB of 2666MHz DDR4 RAM as it's soldered to the board- The audio system on the notebook is weak.

4003,B09BCSNWC1,e,"However, other companies give left & right click button on the mousepad, Lenovo doesn‚Äôt.This causes issues while browsing or copy and one has to look at the keypad to see where the left click or right click is.Otherwise no other issues."

4592,B08G24RGKS,quality,This is built with least quality material.
4593,B08G24RGKS,quality,Camera quality is average.
4594,B08G24RGKS,quality,I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine.
4595,B08G24RGKS,quality,it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it .
4596,B08G24RGKS,quality,"But no issue witnessed.Pros - Good camera, Good speed, Good screen quality, No heating issue if you use it properly, Very less strain on eyes, Ms Office, Window 10.Con - Battery backup is less.I am very happy to buy this, thank you Amazon and Hp."

Please share.model number just require pl send , this good see this laptop .But I have other compare to both."
4671,B08G24RGKS,price,Brilliant productMost of the configurations available in this price range (less than 40k) were either 4 GB RAM or 1 TB HDDMy base requirement was 8 GB RAM as Win 10 just doesn't work with 4 GB and going for aftermarket RAM on a new laptop did not make senseSecond requirement was SSD.
4672,B08G24RGKS,price,"I activated just by signing in and updating Office.The only other competition to this is Lenovo in similar price bracket, but it has a poor camera."
4673,B08G24RGKS,price,"I have been using Mac but that's twice the price.I wish there were more USB ports, it has 2 USB and 1 C typeThis is default choice in the specs/ requirements so best buy
First got the product delivered couple of days late."
4674,B08G24RGKS,price,"Very good product in these range, under 40,000-i get it in 38,000 somethingIt saya 7hours battery life but it is near about 5hours , it's very good üëç.It take near 2 hours to charge fully.It has ssd , it starts in seconds.Good for light gaming üéÆ , light - average video editing.It take another hard drive for storage, after sometime.It's good in these price range, go for it."
4675,B08G24RGKS,price,You'll have to keep volume at 40-50% for general use.You'll not get any other laptop with this sound quality at this price.
4676,B08G24RGKS,price,"You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price."
4677,B08G24RGKS,price,Slim and light weight the important things at low prices is the RAM which is 8 GB with i3 processor make the performance excellent.
4678,B08G24RGKS,price,"# 8gb Ram, 256gb nvme SSD at a decent price point is a great deal..# laptop is pretty thin and light, good for carrying around and regular usage.# Has good processing speed due to nvme ssd n 8gb Ram installed in it..# Lag free windows 10 experience# Comes bundled with student/home ms office, just need to activate it.# Looks and build quality are moderated but decent enough for the given price point.# Display quality as mentioned by some of the buyers isn't that bad either, i could hardly notice any problems in it..# Has got a good sound quality."
4679,B08G24RGKS,price,"Pros: The product is amazing as it has 8gb Nvme ram and 256gb SSD storageIt boots up within seconds and is very fast, It comes with pre installed MS Office and Student editon which is a boon for students.Cons: Not so good webcam  And marks on the laptop when  we touch it but it is manageable at such a good price range of approx 39k INROVERALL I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU THIS LAPTOP."
4680,B08G24RGKS,price,Track pad could have been more smooth  but a mouse will do the work.Overall: Great Laptop for 35000 price range.
4681,B08G24RGKS,price,"Before you go for this product, also keep in mind that how much money you spend on this laptop.After exchange, I got it at 32k.At this price, it's more than I expected.Intel i3 processor is enough for my needs."
4682,B08G24RGKS,price,Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) .
4683,B08G24RGKS,price,At 34k price point it is a value for money product.
4684,B08G24RGKS,price,"For the price there aren't many laptops under 40K with offer 8GB RAM, 256 GB SSD, and Office as well."
4685,B08G24RGKS,price,This laptop has some good compromises for the price.
4686,B08G24RGKS,price,Build is good in this price rangeCons:1.
4687,B08G24RGKS,price,I searched compared with other laptop also .when i bought i purchased for 36k i dont know why price been increased while that time some of the model like asus laptop avita were good also they were not some thing to look like asus had 4gb ram and typically having hesitant to with amd ryzen processor.This laptop till now basically fine it will feel compact also microsoft office free version preinstalled that also major advantage there are some things to be look after like:- Only one time i faced lag or hang i dont know  why i had put my pen drive so due to that may be i faced other than that i didnt hang problem.-While update notification the laptop like flickering the screen blackish that i also faced twice after updating it will not come.-Also keyboard also it  good feel will not comfortable to type it will feel cheap feel quality but mousepad feels fine.
4688,B08G24RGKS,price,it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it .
4689,B08G24RGKS,price,It's good for this price range as i3.

4730,B08G24RGKS,office,You can do smoothly all ppt presentation and other MS office stuffs.
4731,B08G24RGKS,office,"Please be aware that the windows office they promise doesn't get activated...I ve been trying for last three days and have given up ... Don't believe in the ad ....Please buy from authorised dealer .....
Quality of the laptop is worst within few days of usage screen is broke after a careful usage."
4732,B08G24RGKS,office,"Good product
MS office was installed by hp support after getting product which was not installed but sticked on system."
4733,B08G24RGKS,office,It's best laptop for office work.
4734,B08G24RGKS,office,But good battery back up and pre installed office10 and ms office.

4736,B08G24RGKS,office,"\xa0I have facing hanging problem in my this hp laptop and I have purchased this laptop in past few days and then coming this problem and I m work for some time in this laptop why coming this problem
Ms office is installed but when activated it lasted only for 30 days."
4737,B08G24RGKS,office,"We need to purchase MS office on our own.Overall the performance is good, no lag while working in MS office or Browsing."
4738,B08G24RGKS,battery,"Very good product in these range, under 40,000-i get it in 38,000 somethingIt saya 7hours battery life but it is near about 5hours , it's very good üëç.It take near 2 hours to charge fully.It has ssd , it starts in seconds.Good for light gaming üéÆ , light - average video editing.It take another hard drive for storage, after sometime.It's good in these price range, go for it."
4739,B08G24RGKS,battery,"You will not get any other laptop with this type of performance, speed, sound and battery for this amazing price."
4740,B08G24RGKS,battery,"The battery back is more than 5 hours which is also food
This is the worst product ever."
4741,B08G24RGKS,battery,"When contacted the HP customer service team, they were so casual about this, saying - ""you are lucky that the battery was not affected otherwise it would have melted and caught on fire""."
4742,B08G24RGKS,battery,"When asked how did this even happen with a brand new laptop, we were informed - ""electronic hai kuch bhi kabhi bhi ho sakta hai""And the best part is that HP\'s warranty does not cover burns and battery melts."
4743,B08G24RGKS,battery,Only disadvantages are the screen's viewing angle are terrible and back lit keyboard is a must for laptop which costs more than 35k.Apart from these issue it is one hell of a laptop in the price point and its super light and compact with a decent battery backup of 5hrs + for now although I guess it will fall to 3hrs in around 6 months time as per my experience with Hp( Finger Crossed ) .
4744,B08G24RGKS,battery,"Those who are looking for laptop for study and personal purposes can consider this product.Booting speed: 4.5/5Camera: 4/5display: 3.5/5lightweight: 5/5charging: 5/5battery backup: 4.5/5overall: 4.5/5
Speed is fast."
4745,B08G24RGKS,battery,No FHD display but a decent battery life.
4746,B08G24RGKS,battery,it necessary to wireless keyboard .-while turning pressing power button for turning on the laptop i feel that i have to press 2 times for that i dont know why but boot time is like 3 seconds .These are all things that need to be considered although it is not a major con somehow have to check with that.Performance is decent normal use whilw i played wcc2 game that feels like hiccups happened anyhow it is a decent processor no heating problem or fan noise i didnt heard of till now.Another thing that everyone should after is that battery backup the battery capacity mentioned like 41 or 42whr so claiming less than 7hr majorily i also one of the reason i bought but decent battery backup only charging also take less than 2hrs last 5 percent takes time little battery backup at a stretch use u will less than 4 hrs only.Screen quality is hd only it is decent enough.FINAL VERDICT: Overall i suggest for buying this laptop mainly should be based on price only for 42k we can get better laptop also ig u get a price of 35 to 38k it will make much sense and value for money.Also mi laptop learing edition will be there still it is not that available there are not that much review i didnt go for it .
4747,B08G24RGKS,battery,other than it is only available above 40k better buy mi laptop with i5 gen or asus laptop mainly there will be i3 only it will be available Regard with amd processor in amd ryznen 3 or 5 are available in avita brand or some other company also but still not suggest only in case of heating or battery draining issue this with old experience of processor also review of other laptop only im saying.U can buy hp mi acer and asus with ssd option better value .Also thing this laptop im not sure about we cant add ram or expandable that thing need to check after in cas of mi laptop im sure that is not upragable.
4748,B08G24RGKS,battery,"good for light app use , sufficient for school, battery life is not that good can use it home conveniently."
4749,B08G24RGKS,battery,Good battery backup.

4899,B08DDZLCQF,quality,It has a front camera which is Ok in quality but it is placed in a very odd position (near the screen and keyboard joint) which makes it not suitable for most face to face chats.The speed of the laptop is very good.
4900,B08DDZLCQF,quality,"Battery life is decent, about 3-4 hours on a single charge.All ports are located on the back side, not on the sides as in other laptops but this is not much of inconvenience and I am hardly inconvenienced because of this.The nest this about this laptop is the top quality screen."
4901,B08DDZLCQF,quality,"I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled.# Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better# Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive# 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose# 120 GB SSD delivers good performance# Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors."

Bought an Avita laptop and its battery started showing some charging issue on the SECOND Day of receiving the item."

4961,B08DDZLCQF,battery,"I am getting in between 5 hours to 7 hours for very light weight use with battery saving mode enabled.# Camera quality is not upto the mark, could have been better# Mouse trackpad is nice, wide, intuitive# 4 Gig RAM serves the purpose# 120 GB SSD delivers good performance# Bottleneck is created by 2 vCPU Intel Celeron processors."
4962,B08DDZLCQF,battery,The product is awful as battery gets drain quickly and Kudos to Amazon and Seller for brining pocket friendly product at this tight budget situations.
4963,B08DDZLCQF,battery,"Writing this review after 10 days of delivery of the laptop- Yes it is the best cheapest laptop- I did buy the laptop @17K- No heating issue till now(as laptop is new)- Battery works for straight 5 hours(pretty good till now)- speakers are loud and awesome- SSD is a great add on to speed as the laptop contain ceremon processor.- Screen quality and camera quality is too good.About S mode- I removed the S mode on the very first day as I need to install local softwares- I did install billing software(GST) which works smoothly- I did install printer drivers, zoom meeting software.- Till now laptops is very fast and smooth (Don't install heavy softwares)

Value for money
Good choice
I would suggest not to buy this laptop, my Avita laptop battery suddenly stopped working after few months of purchase.I logged service request but they will give you so many excuses and delay the process."
4992,B08DDZLCQF,price,Multitasking - 7 ( considering the price bracket it comes in it is justifiable.9.
4993,B08DDZLCQF,price,"Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it."
4994,B08DDZLCQF,price,from this low priced entry level machine is a foolish thing.
4995,B08DDZLCQF,price,All of this due to 128GB m.2 ssd installed in it.Pros-1- IPS Display 9/102- SSD 9/103- 4-5hr battery backup 7/104- Design 8/105- Build quality 7/10Cons-1- 3.5hr of Charging time2- Charger Quality3- Sometimes mouse trackpad & keys are a bit unresponsive.Verdict- This laptop @13.5-15k price is 100% value for money.Although this laptop equipped with celeron processor but believe me it does what it is meant for.
4996,B08DDZLCQF,price,The price was also decent.
4997,B08DDZLCQF,price,"great Laptop at this prce point..1) great display2)good processor not for gaming those who wants gaming not this laptop buy 30000 or highe price laptop but asphalt 8 runs smooth3)ram also ddr44)128gb ssd apps load fast and boot time 10 second5)so light waight ..battery backup 3 hours  on 100 percent charge..At this price point no other brand offer such a value for money laptop.........
Review after using for 4 days.Pro's -1) Performance - It can easily handle basic tasks such as browsing, MS office, watching movies & online class.2) Storge - Even though we juz get 128gb ssd storage(out of which 94gb is available to use), we can expand Storage using memory card slot."
4998,B08DDZLCQF,price,Avita should focus on this4) Keyboard & mouse pad are hard.3) Build quality - Actually i don't say this as con for the price i paid(13600rs).
4999,B08DDZLCQF,price,I am satisfied with plastic built quality for this price.
5000,B08DDZLCQF,price,"can be done without any problems.As it comes with Windows 10 in S Mode, you have an option to disable it but I preferred not to, because its Secured mode and it helps to keep laptop safe from any Malware and saving you additional Antivirus cost.This laptop gives me battery backup of AT LEAST 4hrs with uninterrupted online class.Standby time would be definitely beyond that.Build quality is good according to its price."
5001,B08DDZLCQF,price,No other laptop available in this price range6.

5006,B08DDZLCQF,price,"L1 and L2 cache are on lower side, no L3 cache.# Speaker is loud enough, lacks the fineness / Quality, but does the job, you can watch YouTube, Movies, listen to songs..Overall, a nice well built laptop at this price with decent performance for basic activities, don't load it up with too many apps running in parallel, it will serve you well.Also, wait for offer price."
5007,B08DDZLCQF,price,"It is a value for money product when bought at price around 17K, Not at its normal price which 19K

5008,B08DDZLCQF,price,I didn't expect such a fabulous product for such a low price.
5009,B08DDZLCQF,price,"Believe me you are gonna love this afterall in this price range you can't find a better deal anywhere but at first you have to search is there any service centre available nearby your area or not,  If yes then you can buy this without any hesitation.1."
5010,B08DDZLCQF,price,Look and design - awesomeNegetive remarks :- camera quality is ok at this price but not in right place.....if u have to attend a lot of online class or meeting then think before buying it.
5011,B08DDZLCQF,price,In that case it's total price will come closer to other branded laptop.
5012,B08DDZLCQF,price,"Cute and LovelyI bought this mainly for its SSD hard discHighest resolution which you can't get from anyother laptop of this price and this screen sizeIt's a great idea that they've provided all the USB port, charge port, audio port behind the laptop.Works excellently with my favorite ubuntu OS( I removed windows)I don't use laptops for gaming
At this price the product is a bargain."
5013,B08DDZLCQF,price,"I was sceptical about the celeron processor but was pleasantly surprised to see the clock speed it can maintain (around 2.6 GHz) without a fan!SSD makes the performance even better, arguably the best in the price segment.Added plus is windows 10 home bundled!"

Good laptop..... Go for it... No competitor in this price range
Good for small office use  but very fragile
It's been 15 days now and I haven't face any challenges, there is no voice of a fan and even it won't get warm."

5077,B08DDZLCQF,screen,The camera is placed at the bottom of screen.
5078,B08DDZLCQF,screen,Only dealbreaker is the full HD screen and SSD but this can be upgraded anytime later.
5079,B08DDZLCQF,screen,"The AVITAL laptop is worst, wastage of money and time, dont buy it, the camera is just above the key board not with screen which wont allow you to adjust it as per your convenience."
5080,B08DDZLCQF,screen,I unbox the laptop and the laptop screen was full of Scratch and one key was missing .the wrost laptop I have seen I have two laptops that I buyed from Amazon but this was terrible.
5081,B08DDZLCQF,screen,Awesome display.. slight bleed in lower left corner but barely noticeable..no dead pixels.. almost bezel-less screen18.
5082,B08DDZLCQF,money,"Value for money - 9Overall considering the price  of rs15000 and for my case it was rs 7200 (exchanged 10 yr old i3 processor laptop) this laptop does the light job like surfing net and making some ppts and watching video as the laptop has great screen - full hd with anti glare display is something that is unavailable in this price bracket before.Who should consider this laptop ?Anyone who has very light usage microsoft word, office , excel or those who wants a laptop for entertainment purpose, or for online classes, online test series, for attending meetings etcAnyone who wants to run any moderate to heavy apps should stay away from buying it."
5083,B08DDZLCQF,money,Don't expect much from this by spending 13.5 k money.Expecting gaming and editing etc.

5085,B08DDZLCQF,money,"great Laptop at this prce point..1) great display2)good processor not for gaming those who wants gaming not this laptop buy 30000 or highe price laptop but asphalt 8 runs smooth3)ram also ddr44)128gb ssd apps load fast and boot time 10 second5)so light waight ..battery backup 3 hours  on 100 percent charge..At this price point no other brand offer such a value for money laptop.........

5190,B096SHMYJJ,screen,The font / text on screen does not come out sharp.

5451,B093L9SYZP,price,The i5 variant is almost as good as the i7 and the 12 threads make it perfect for heavy compute tasks.The 8gb ram was a little low for my heavy docker/emulator usage so I added in an extra 16gb of ram and it's working perfect so far.It's a bargain for the 60k price I bought it for.
5452,B093L9SYZP,price,"the product ok but it could have been more organised.it is 100 percent value for money should consider in this price range
Amazing can't imagine that I got this laptop at this price."
5453,B093L9SYZP,price,One of the best displays I have ever seen in a laptop in this price range.
5454,B093L9SYZP,ram,It uses 8gb 3200mhz ram stick in my variant and there is one more free slot for upgrading.

5457,B093L9SYZP,ram,"And specially if you are planning of upgrading it latter undoubtedly its the best laptop you can bring home.It has a empty 2.5"" slot where you can fit a 2.5 hdd or ssd for extra storage.And with its 2 ram slots with max capacity of 32 GB each you can upgrade your ram to total of 64 GB .Along with that its new turbo cooling technology and 144hz display combined with Nvidia 1650 graphic insurances best gaming experience."
5458,B093L9SYZP,ram,All configurations are matched with the production description.The only issue I am seeing is no indicator for showing for battery charging except in taskbar.If it is available in 14 inch with 16gb ram then there is no laptop who can beat this one.

5461,B095S8HPMY,screen,But as long we don't disturb the screen it will not enlarge or depends on the intensity.But when you start taking notes write something we have to use the touch screen.
5462,B095S8HPMY,screen,Check if your laptop has an screen bleed issue.
5463,B095S8HPMY,screen,Better to get it resolved soon.And main thing I have brought this touch laptop is to take notes not for touch Interface.In this case windows doesn't have an better ui like android does.With an 14 inch screen and 1.5 kg.

5724,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Haha that portability is what main thing of a laptopüòúPersonally kinda like this design simple and sleek.Touchpad is so smooth.Backlit keyboard is awesome and it's pleasing for typing too.Processor Is beast.. ryzen 5 5500u at 42k.
5725,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Backlit keyboard5.
5726,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Display is good but doesn't come with anti-glare display.Keyboard does seems like made of cheap plastic and you could see the flex in keyboard as well.Although laptop's performance will not disappoint you.
5727,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Sometimes there is little heating over the keyboard when used for longer duration..but it gets normal again after few mins.Now pros:1.
5728,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Backlit keyboard makes this laptop sexyüëåüèªüëåüèª..
5729,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"I am a fan of HP Laptop products.So I purchased this best performer.Its been a month I bought this model.Its lightweight,good batterylife,and good IPS display.Its really so fast.I am totally happy with this and I recommend it to all.Special factor i liked was its backlight keyboard.But still i wanted to open up one thing honestly.1.Heating is there (which I already know before purchasing,since its a lightweight model).Gaming Laptops are the beast in all sectors,but I can't think of a model with weight.I prefer lightweight ones,even if I have to sacrifice gaming.Hence i chose this and im happy with my daily tasks like editing,coding etc
I am a student and I needed a laptop for my online classes."
5730,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,NVME SSD makes it even more faster.Display is awesome.Backlit keyboard is also looks cool.It is lighter in weight.
5731,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Best is we get a backlit keyboard which is not mentioned in the description.
5732,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"The laptop has many features and I laki the laptop it have backlit keyboard and dual ram channel but only one thing that they have mentioned antiglare screen but is is glossy other wise every thing is correct
This laptop come with very stylish look and light weight and come with backlit."
5733,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,The display is not anti reflective but it is too good.Light weight.Speaker is awesome.Trackpad and keyboard is good.Cons:Only 512mb of vram and the bios is locked.It would have been a perfect machine if it had atleast 2gb Vram.
5734,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,Backlit keyboard is also very good.
5735,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"Best laptop in 50kBest processor 5500uGood ips displayGood backlight keyboardNo heating no fan noiseBoots in 10sec

5736,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"Fast, HD screen, backlit keyboard, starts within seconds, value for money."
5737,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"Too small and you will get 476gb, Alexa will support for only to play music No keyboard protector not worth of 53k
Educational, Team meeting, presentation, programming
Worst, I received a different model number which is not present in HP website."
5738,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"Ryzen 5, 5500 u with ssd and backlit keyboard at this price is unbelievable."
5739,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"I like design, battery life , Processing,Slightly disappointed with camera, brightness can be more and antiglare is more disappointing
The performance of the laptop is top-notch but something don't know why it will take time to open.The keyboard is very impressive

Screen qulity and build quality is best."
5740,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,"Nice work
I like it
Laptop is not getting started even if it is fully charged, it start after the  charger is plugged with the switch
Good laptop at reasonable price..
Anti glare keyboard is awesome, screen quality is very good."
5741,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,I just fixed a matt screen protector and a keyboard silicone cover - There is some amount of typical HP bloatware but you can get that removed.50k laptops are usually a compromise of too many things and they manage to underwhelm you in almost all areas.
5742,B0928TPR8H,keyboard,""", ""I have purchased this fq1030au model laptop from hp authorised dealer, and it's mind blowing purchase, it's screen quality, battery life, multiple tasking, processing, backlit keyboard is awesome."

5746,B0928TPR8H,performance,I have been using most of the basic applications including PyCharm and I never been faced any lags and performance issue.Quality:When its comes to quality and no doubt about HP and they are one of top most laptop manufacturing in India.
5747,B0928TPR8H,performance,"Awesome performance!I did a little bit of light gaming by playing valorant and it runs perfectly, no performance issue observed.High-end software such as matlab runs perfectly without any slow down.Battery life is good."
5748,B0928TPR8H,performance,"I was able to use it for about 4.5-5 hrs even while running multiple applications together, some casual while others more performance oriented.Display is not anti-glare, so not suitable to use in sunlight."
5749,B0928TPR8H,performance,"However, viewing angle is decently broad (about 150 degress).It has WiFi 5, however, there are no problems in connectivity.Although I find the camera quality slightly below average, but it's a reasonable compromise for its price (bought it for INR 51k)College students can certainly consider this for a budget laptop with good performance and portability."
5750,B0928TPR8H,performance,Display is good but doesn't come with anti-glare display.Keyboard does seems like made of cheap plastic and you could see the flex in keyboard as well.Although laptop's performance will not disappoint you.
5751,B0928TPR8H,performance,"Speakers are great and the best part is the CPU performance, Ryzen 5500u coupled with 8 GB RAM slaps!Looks pretty good but doesn't feel very sturdy so use it with caution and care, another small negative is the touchpad, design wise feels a little awkward to me.Other than that, my requirements as a Student are more than satisfied.I am very happy with my purchase, would highly recommend it to anyone."
5752,B0928TPR8H,performance,The performance is good... Sleek & Stylish; hands down!But it got hanged multiple times while making and reviewing some videos.Surprised!
5753,B0928TPR8H,performance,Too early to comment on performance.

5755,B0928TPR8H,performance,But only last 1-2hrs on performance mode.Ryzen 5 5500u is best at this this price pointif you mant more processing power go for ryzen 7 5700u.diplay is goodbuild quality is not that good.
5756,B0928TPR8H,performance,Ryzen 5500 U is delivering really great results in multi-core performance.

5841,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast."
5842,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,You cant even hear its fans churning in the summer when your ceiling fan makes more noise than your laptop cracking games at performance mode üòùBattery: Reviews here are so negetive about battery but I found it to last around 6-7 hours when doing casual work.
5843,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Well still, Id say battery performance is sufficient."
5844,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,But the battery charges fast enough as it is.Build quality: Legion is legion.
5845,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Use hydbrid mode to enhance battery backup and use the inbuilt GPU and 1650 simultaneously.Battery: Battery is better than I expected when watching movies and screen at 50%-70% it can easily survive for 5-6 hrs or maybe more.
5846,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Also you should switch into hybrid mode in order to get the most out of the battery.
5847,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"The laptop performs good, good wifi,good gpu,fast ram but it has a major compromise on display, battery and camera."
5848,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,The colours on the display are not that good and the battery is decent.
5849,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Must buy if u don't care bout battery üîã.Edit- after updates battery is good and the camera is improved.
5850,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Overall I'll rate it 4.5/5, as it lacks RGB keyboard and battery and colour accuracy."
5851,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"I am the kinda guy that does not care about the battery life OR the weight of the device, not at least when you know you bought a gaming laptop."
5852,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Still, it weighs around 2KG and the battery lasts for around 4-5 hrs with normal usage, which, I must say is more than enough.I would say the display could have been better with the color accuracy but this thing with a 120Hz refresh rate does a farely good job averall."
5853,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.
5854,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"But apart from that it's a perfect device and I would suggest to go for it
The screen is more on a warmer side ,Battery is averaged for office usage or entertainment purpose (lasts around 2.5 hours at 3brightnessIt has 0-7 level for brightness and 0-1 is useless with close to 0 visibility due to warm shades produced on screenRGB production is valued at 33.8%For gaming battery lasts around 50 minutesVery good drivers for sound production and can be used for midi controls over productionSound card badLaptop turns into thermal mode often during games setting at ultra or highCS:GO would easily turn the fans on making it cause more power
I JUST LOVED IT.Don't compare it with any laptop under 75k, it really has destroyed the competition.HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS THAT I FOUND AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE ...PROS1."
5855,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"However,The battery is the biggest disappointment."
5856,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works.
5857,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass.
5858,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Upon inspection it had a layer of laminate.Okay the first impressions were:1) Laptop is blazing fast man (With the pairing of Ryzen 5 and GTX 1650) it's a feast to your eye coming from 60hz.2) Camera was really bad (considering every gaming laptop camera)3) Battery is really bad (You have to limit your usage pretty much to no internet for getting a good percentage of battery left).
5859,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,I used YouTube for like an hour and the battery depleted way soon.
5860,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup."
5861,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"I just bought the product online on june 1 but the warranty says its already activated on April 2021 and am getting around 11months of warranty instead of a year of series
Good boot uo speeds and smooth overall usage in terms of response,loading times for softwares and gaming.I can't say much about the battery, I use it plugged in 90% of the time, with conservative battery which keeps it from going above 60% charge, so you can say the battery is just like any other gaming laptop out there.The screen isn't as bright as I'd like for certain situations.It's not something that's a serious problem, you can manage with the brightness it provides, but making it a brighter screen would've made it even better than it already is.Overall the build is very good, feels sturdy.I'd say it's a good option consider for the 60 to 70k range of laptops."
5862,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,But I faced issue with battery as it is getting discharge very fast so I asked for replacement Now it is working fine.
5863,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Everything is basically gliding in it
Received in excellent packagingAs far as purchase is concerned not a single time I have regretted this purchase for this price, laptop looks much better in reality than compare to image shown here,it does not look like gaming machine(this was my primary reason to buy it) it's fast, no lags,Amd ryzen 5 does handle all task with so much ease, it boots up in less than 5 seconds, does not heat up even after prolong use,keyboard is excellentOnly area where it could have been better was 1)battery expect around 2.5 to 3hours of backup battery2)camera it could have been better
It is a very very good and great laptop that I have bought from Amazon."
5864,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"If it would have been a rgb backlit keyboard then it would have been better(9) Battery - Surprisingly its good as I was getting a usage of 5-6hrs with 50% brightness, hybrid mode and battery saver turned on
‚Ä¢First of all the battery discharges so quickly like within 1 2 hours of watching videos or surfing and when it comes to gaming battery discharges to 20 percent in 30 minutes when it's 100 percent changed.‚Ä¢There is a minor issue with the keyboard or it is just me, the thing is there is so low key travel like i don't even feel like I'm pressing a key or not again this can differ person to person.‚Ä¢The last thing and the most important one is the display it went blank 2 times when i restarted the pc like for one and half hour it was blank i was literally shaking and nervous like what should i do now but after watching some video and researching about it i found out it automatically recovers from that by closing it and waiting for 15 20 minutes, this is an extremely dangerous fault which needs to be fixed asap.I will give this laptop 6 out of 10."
5865,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Supports smart charge, good for battery life when plugged in 24x7.Screen if really good."
5866,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Problem started from day one and there is no support either from Amazon and issues with hardware and software both , May he vendor is trying to sale all his refurbished laptops
Lenovo legion is a good laptop for gaming and office use, updated with latest BIOS and other updates from lenovo software, build quality is very good, display is good, over all happy to get this legion after trying for many days, still testing the battery performance will update after few days of use."
5867,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,I usually get a battery backup of around 4hrs during my online work.
5868,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"It exceded my expectations  in terms of performance and build qualityit gives abt 150 fps in valorant all high settigns120 on high settings in fortnitetalking abt battery life its great around 5 hours of normal use(like youtube ,web browsing etc)track pad works greatdisplay is also nice 120 hz i coud'nt see any ghosting issuesThe fans are also not that loud
I am using this laptop for almost 4 months now i am very happy with my purchase."
5869,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"There is only one con till date which i find in this laptop ie battery life, being a gaming laptop its battery life sucks."
5870,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Otherwise its gives maximum 1.5 to 2 hours of battery life.
5871,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,You can enable hybrid mode in vantage setting to icrease battery life to 6-7 hrs.
5872,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"\xa0Product arrived in good condition , packaging was up to the mark , overall performance is good, however webcam could have been better , average battery life 4 hours at most which is understandable being a gaming laptop ."
5873,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,I love the laptop build quality...It is really good among this segment..The battery life is average but it can be increased upto 6 to 8 hr if you put the laptop on silent mode as well as hybrid mode which restrict the dedicated gpu usage..so you can disable it just by enable hybrid mode in lenovo vintage app..The keyboard is really good.
5874,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,!Great thermals.. high refresh rate... Good battery !!
5875,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Only 2 things that could hv been better are- battery life for normal usage is not enough(2-3 hrs) and camera quality could hv been better like its competitors in same price range.
5876,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"my amd radeon software app doesn't work and ssd recieve data sk hynix all person said sdd brand samsund but show sk hynix why
Working amazingly for gaming...battery life under normal conditions goes for 5 hours or so and while playing game like dota2 it reduces to 3 hours...however always plug in while gaming so this doesn't really matter
Its perfect for gaming and handles thermals well."
5877,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Camera quality and battery is on the downside but it is manageable.My only concern is that the intake vents are comparatively big which supports thermals but also intake dust.
5878,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Really good battery life for a gaming laptop.
5879,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Useless product as per battery is concern.Lenovo claims battery back up for mor than  6 hours.But it lasts hardly for 2.30 hours even when on quite mode,50% brightness  and document work only ."
5880,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"and microphone muted and not working pls careful to amazon as it is not right
The laptop is good, the product was delivered well, satisfied with the experience
Has 5 hour battery life which is the highest in gaming laptops of this range plus really sturdy built quality , best cooling system and a beast of a gaming laptop in this range
Good for gaming."
5881,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"But u may get disappointed in battery life.But charger comes with 170w speed charger
Got this for 55K after an exchange of i5-2nd gen. For that price this is awesome.Used it for 3 Months now and I have zero complaints."
5882,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"\xa0Very good legion 5 for gamingRyzen 5 4600H and Nvidia 1650 extremely good.....
Amazing laptopGot 150-175 fps in valorantNo heating issues you should definitely go for itFirst I was also doubtful about the product but when I received the laptop it was amazing .If the product come in deal of the day buy it immediately
Battery life is poor, hardly useable for 3.5 hrs.Display is super smooth .And overall it's a value for money laptop..üëç
Everything is good, except for battery life."
5883,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Screen brightness is low at 250 nits max.Need to plug in every now and then because it has only 60 watt hour battery.
5884,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Thank you
Mainly good for gaming,little over priced and the battery is Ok , you have to play game when plugged in socket."
5885,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"During light task battery back up upto 2 and half hours
It has really some cool lenovo features.Battery life for a normal use is around 4-5hrs.Booting time is really amazing(less than 10sec)."
5886,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"has very good battery charge very fast and lasts very long not done enough gaming only played minecraft which ran very smooth got it today itself
The media could not be loaded."
5887,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"bilkul shi h for gaming , camera , battery working perfectlybatery on movie 6 to u hours running fast while gaming and camera is also good

5890,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,If looking for long battery life... .
5891,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"There is no flow whatsoever in using this laptop, comparatively better battery life, good screen refresh rate and incredible performance

5892,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"Average battery life an nice camera

5896,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Interesting is you can upgrade battery to 80watts .
5897,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,It improves to some extent battery life definitely the write and read speeds.3.
5898,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Keeping 250 nits give you better battery life with 60watt battery.4.
5899,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Even HP omen this price model has less watt battery.Even ThinkPad E series is 54wh battery.5.
5900,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"60 Wh battery slightly more than others, 170 watt power brick highest in the range i think.7."
5901,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Battery life is average considering its a gamming laptop i got 3 hr+ battery.
5902,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"I get this laptop in 62k in Amazon sale ,I will recommend this laptop over HP pavilion & asus tuf 15 because main advantage of this laptop over other is its thermal system its best thermal system i ever seen in such that price you will go with hap pavilion both are same but hp pavilion 4600 r5 is expensive than legion 5 but both laptop are good ignore asus tuf its thermal system is not as other two laptopPros- display is far superior than others laptop(120hz) in same price range and i already told you about thermals , keyboard is nice , build quality is good, it has its unique design as you see in pictures, speaker are pretty loud & battery backup is good i means its really good it includes 170w charger laptop have 4 usb 3 ports means you don't need extra hub , boot time is same as all r5 4600 laptopCons- weight 2.3 kg i know 2.3 is not heavy but once if you buy laptop then you will realize why i am saying this its heavy , design many of like that kind of design but some not if u don't like this design or you want leaa heavy laptop or you don't want Chinese product then go for hp pavillion 15 it is also good but little bit expensive
Most indemanding laptop in india for absolute reason.Pros:1."
5903,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"üò∞ very disappointing
No brand is giving you 60Wh battery in 65k, what are you waiting for just go for it, you won't regret it
This laptop is awesome I baught it in 67 in offline storeGive high fps in almost all games  üòç must buy if your budget is 70k batter then asus rog and tuf with same specsThe thermal is good never go above 65¬∞c.Over all best gaming laptop in this price üõê
Doesn't meet the expectations better to go for dell g series and Intel processor and is becoming sluggish.. better to go i7 or atleast i5
Gaming could be done at high settings with minor glitchoverall a good project as compared to other i5 machines.THE ONLY ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFEI KID YOU NOT BRUV!This has pathetic backup."
5904,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,This has no battery whatsoever.
5905,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,Have to always keep plugged in.Buy if you are okay with a laptop with no battery!
5906,B08JLR7LPQ,battery,"I'm using it for a week,Pros-1.Ryzen 5 4600H with GTX1650 gives a good perfomance2.battery backup is good3.has 4 USB ports of 3rd generation4.no overheating issuesCons-1.keyboard could be RGB  Overall experience- best pick if your budget is 68k
for gaming go blind...it gives me an average of 150+ FPS every time in VALORENT.bulid quality is very good.cooling system is very effective.best value in 65k (sale)it comes with nice professional looks.it has the MUX switch which is quite impressive in this bujet.... very satisfied with this Lenovo product."
5907,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"Can be upgraded upto 64 gigs based on videos online.4) Battery life-60whr battery.Updated Battery Life (70% brightness, startup apps off, better battery + balance mode, hybrid mode on, keyboard lighting level 1)8.5 -9 hours watching offline movies on VLC with airplane mode on.7-8 hours reading PDFs, making notes, little browsing, office apps.5-6 hours light usage like browsing, listening to songs, youtube, background apps open like discord, telegram etc(Do not use chrome, battery and ram eater)5-7 hours YouTube playback4 hours medium usage2-3 hours heavy usage1 hour gaming.Battery life heavily DEPENDS on what you're doing."
5908,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"Check YT videos for gaming reviews.Cinebench R23 gave score of 8600, CPU boosts upto 57 watts(can be more?"
5909,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"The laptop is not the lightest out there like Zephyrus G14, but the weight is manageable considering it's a mid-level gaming laptop.I would go for this one rather than IdeaPad gaming 3 and this laptop is superior in every aspect."
5910,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Surprised by the temperatures which don't go more than 65‚Å∞C even after long gaming sessions.
5911,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"Great for movie watching andif you really want to, for gaming too."
5912,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast."
5913,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"My purpose is programming plus gaming and my boy this has given me everything ‚ù§ Gaming takes a lot from hardwares, so i am getting good fps an average of 45 to 60 fps on AAA title games like Rdr2, Control so on."
5914,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"(By casual I mean running android studio, chrome and terminal together) Dont expect it to last more than 3 hrs when gaming tho."
5915,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I am telling you my review on this laptop after 3 weeks of useüòå.Looks:- It have very premium design looks  like very professional not gaming  laptop üòäBuild quality:- It is made of premium plastic not metal , but very good quality üòå feels very goodSpeaker:- speakers are very loud and very good clear sound like doulby üòÇ(Harman audioüòå)Processor:- Amd ryzen 4600h is very powerful processor it is better than i7 also very good for gaming and multitasking üßê.Boot time is only6 sec.Thermals:- It's thermals are very good ."
5916,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I had tested, It doesn't heat at all after 4 hours non-stop gaming."
5917,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"ü•∂Battery :- For gaming:- 3 hours max and for other:- 5-6 hours easily performüôÉ.But charging is very fast 50% charge in just 30 min.Display:- It's has 120 hz display with perfect colour accuracy , good for gaming and editing also."
5918,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I watched movies in 2k hd are very good to see üôàConclusion:- Best laptop for this price 67k .It's good for gaming ,video editing and multitasking üßê."
5919,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries.
5920,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,It is a good laptop for gaming.
5921,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Overall a good gaming laptop.
5922,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"For gamers it's good to go, one important thing with this machine is like is with it's clean minimal look, doesn't looks like a bulky gaming one, matte plastic finish it's good."
5923,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"N people are working on i5 n ryzen 3 to creation purpose so why can't one do it on this good machine.Rest everything is good.I won't b telling about the negative one's, because it's gonna be therein in every machine.Much metta to all ‚ú®
It have very premium design lookslike very professional not gaminglaptop."
5924,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"As an IT professional, i use to implement long hours of coding  and yes also gaming."
5925,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"After usage of this laptop, I recommend this to everyone whose needs are gaming, multitasking."
5926,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I am the kinda guy that does not care about the battery life OR the weight of the device, not at least when you know you bought a gaming laptop."
5927,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,You cant change the 120Hz setting to 60Hz though.About the gaming performance: it actually is very scilent and thermally perfected.
5928,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,This Laptop is the best buy u can get under 70k if u r looking for a gaming machine.The thermals are amazing... You can play most of the AAA titles without any lag from medium to high settings... And even though the material is plastic it's biuld like a tank doesn't feel cheap in any way...However there is one con with this device and no it's not the screen brightness like it or not this is the best screen resolution and brightness u can get under this budget and a couple more devices use it...
5929,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"But apart from that it's a perfect device and I would suggest to go for it
The screen is more on a warmer side ,Battery is averaged for office usage or entertainment purpose (lasts around 2.5 hours at 3brightnessIt has 0-7 level for brightness and 0-1 is useless with close to 0 visibility due to warm shades produced on screenRGB production is valued at 33.8%For gaming battery lasts around 50 minutesVery good drivers for sound production and can be used for midi controls over productionSound card badLaptop turns into thermal mode often during games setting at ultra or highCS:GO would easily turn the fans on making it cause more power
I JUST LOVED IT.Don't compare it with any laptop under 75k, it really has destroyed the competition.HERE ARE SOME PROS AND CONS THAT I FOUND AFTER A MONTH OF USAGE ...PROS1."
5930,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"DESIGN => Just loved the minimalistic design, I love aggressive gaming look but I loved  this minimal design.3."
5931,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"TEMPERATURES => One of the key selling  features of this laptop is it's cooling system, it  really is the coolest gaming laptop in the market  rn.4."
5932,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Bought this mainly for mid-tier gaming and coding.Listed out Pros & Cons below.Pros: 1) Good laptop for AAA games if you are looking to run them at medium settings and around 60fpsAC Valhalla - 45+ fpsAC Odyssey - 50+ fpsThe Division 2 - 60+ fpsStar Wars: Jedi fallen Order - 60+ fpsGTA V - 80+ fps2) Pretty good sound system and a snappy keyboard.3) Awesome cooling system where temps hardly go above 80.Cons: 1) Screen brightness is too low to my likeness.2) Battery backup is really pathetic even while not gaming.
5933,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"thermals are amazing.get ur legion too guys, its better than tuf, nitro and pavilion gaming."
5934,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I am writing for 2 days usages .Battery - 85%Standing 4 to 5 hrs without gaming.Speed - 90%Login and logout , page surfing all are goodDisplay - 100%Smooth looking and good to viewCamera - 75%Good in meet callsSound - 85%Slight noise is there but good oneHardware - 100%Matt finish , quality keys , smooth ports and keybord light nice lookingOS - 100%Original OS but MS Office is trail only not original that's disappointed lotOverall - 90%Go for it ."
5935,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,The laptop boots up in 5 seconds and generally uses around 30 percent of the processor for general gaming.
5936,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness.
5937,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Touchoad is really good smooth and highly responsive.BATTERY - you cant expect too much battery life from a gaming laptop but if you use this laptop on hybrid mode and at quiet mode i got 5 hours of screen on time with youtube and general works.
5938,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass.
5939,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment.
5940,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Upon inspection it had a layer of laminate.Okay the first impressions were:1) Laptop is blazing fast man (With the pairing of Ryzen 5 and GTX 1650) it's a feast to your eye coming from 60hz.2) Camera was really bad (considering every gaming laptop camera)3) Battery is really bad (You have to limit your usage pretty much to no internet for getting a good percentage of battery left).
5941,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Come on man that's no way fair.6) Thermals are pretty good after a hour of CSGO and there were no framedrops or so.7) Would really recommend this laptop for anybody who can roam around with the adaptor given and are in need of a proper gaming lot with good thermals.
5942,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,The performance and gaming has no lag so far.
5943,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I just bought the product online on june 1 but the warranty says its already activated on April 2021 and am getting around 11months of warranty instead of a year of series
Good boot uo speeds and smooth overall usage in terms of response,loading times for softwares and gaming.I can't say much about the battery, I use it plugged in 90% of the time, with conservative battery which keeps it from going above 60% charge, so you can say the battery is just like any other gaming laptop out there.The screen isn't as bright as I'd like for certain situations.It's not something that's a serious problem, you can manage with the brightness it provides, but making it a brighter screen would've made it even better than it already is.Overall the build is very good, feels sturdy.I'd say it's a good option consider for the 60 to 70k range of laptops."
5944,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Been using it for 2 months for gaming/development purposes.
5945,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,I don't have much idea about technicalities but i know good graphics when i see them.At this price point it is absolutely worth it as it is a great gaming laptop as well as professional laptop.I like the look in particular because it doesn't look like other gaming laptops which look straight out of a teenager's aggressive wet dream.
5946,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"Everything is basically gliding in it
Received in excellent packagingAs far as purchase is concerned not a single time I have regretted this purchase for this price, laptop looks much better in reality than compare to image shown here,it does not look like gaming machine(this was my primary reason to buy it) it's fast, no lags,Amd ryzen 5 does handle all task with so much ease, it boots up in less than 5 seconds, does not heat up even after prolong use,keyboard is excellentOnly area where it could have been better was 1)battery expect around 2.5 to 3hours of backup battery2)camera it could have been better
It is a very very good and great laptop that I have bought from Amazon."

(1) Build quality- It really feels premium in hands .The screen flex  is negligible and it doesn't wobble too(2) Display- It's crisp and clear."
5951,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,Also it has a high refresh rate of 120hz which makes your gaming experience much more smoother and fasterIf it would have been a 300 nits panel then it would have been better.Although this 250 nits panel is also good but can't be used in harsh sunlight(3) Performance- The ryzen 5 4600h easily beats i7 9th gen and almost equivalent to i7 10th gen.
5952,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,The fans are too quiet and it doesn't heat at all even long hours of gaming or working(5) Speaker- They are so damn good and also has a bass effect.
5953,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"If it would have been a rgb backlit keyboard then it would have been better(9) Battery - Surprisingly its good as I was getting a usage of 5-6hrs with 50% brightness, hybrid mode and battery saver turned on
‚Ä¢First of all the battery discharges so quickly like within 1 2 hours of watching videos or surfing and when it comes to gaming battery discharges to 20 percent in 30 minutes when it's 100 percent changed.‚Ä¢There is a minor issue with the keyboard or it is just me, the thing is there is so low key travel like i don't even feel like I'm pressing a key or not again this can differ person to person.‚Ä¢The last thing and the most important one is the display it went blank 2 times when i restarted the pc like for one and half hour it was blank i was literally shaking and nervous like what should i do now but after watching some video and researching about it i found out it automatically recovers from that by closing it and waiting for 15 20 minutes, this is an extremely dangerous fault which needs to be fixed asap.I will give this laptop 6 out of 10."

5962,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"Don't Think much just buy it:)
Go for it.Cooling system is best.Throttling is also good.Using from last 2 months with extreme load and heavy gaming and still working smooth without any issue.Battery life is 3-4 hrs without gaming basic use."

5968,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"my amd radeon software app doesn't work and ssd recieve data sk hynix all person said sdd brand samsund but show sk hynix why
Working amazingly for gaming...battery life under normal conditions goes for 5 hours or so and while playing game like dota2 it reduces to 3 hours...however always plug in while gaming so this doesn't really matter
Its perfect for gaming and handles thermals well."
5969,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"Screen goes maximum only 250 nits which is below average and there is screen bleeding which makes laptop hard to use in dark environment.Overall laptop and build quality is good but it is heavier than expected.The best thing is that thermal, no matter how much game you play it is never noticable
A perfect laptop for productivity and casual gaming don't think too much thermals are super fan noise is low

Doesn't meet the expectations better to go for dell g series and Intel processor and is becoming sluggish.. better to go i7 or atleast i5
Gaming could be done at high settings with minor glitchoverall a good project as compared to other i5 machines.THE ONLY ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFEI KID YOU NOT BRUV!This has pathetic backup."
5995,B08JLR7LPQ,gaming,"I'm using it for a week,Pros-1.Ryzen 5 4600H with GTX1650 gives a good perfomance2.battery backup is good3.has 4 USB ports of 3rd generation4.no overheating issuesCons-1.keyboard could be RGB  Overall experience- best pick if your budget is 68k
for gaming go blind...it gives me an average of 150+ FPS every time in VALORENT.bulid quality is very good.cooling system is very effective.best value in 65k (sale)it comes with nice professional looks.it has the MUX switch which is quite impressive in this bujet.... very satisfied with this Lenovo product."

Better Beast üíØ I Am Experienced To Use Smooth Gaming Performance In Legion Ryzen 5 üíØ You Will Check Out
I got my laptop in May and it had auto restart issue from starting and since then I am contacting Lenovo customer care but they don't even know how to fix it and keep saying we are working on the issue."
6001,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"I liked everything about this lappy feels great in hands I only faced battery issue which is common in all gaming laptops but makes this different is that super rapid pro charging which charged my lappy from 20 to 80 in 45-50 mins.. that's to kool this is best value for money lappy
This lappy is awesome, at this price point truly a beast."
6002,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Buy this if you want an entry level workstation at this price.
6003,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Hate  the quality control compared to the premium price the laptop cuts from our pocketsThis is so annoying in the pandemic it really difficult if these types of things occurGuys, there is a serious issue with Quality Control from Lenovo I guess they are selling their defective product now as there aren\'t many stocks of this laptopDon\'t get me wrong the laptop is top-notch but these quality control issues make it worstI want a new replacement from Amazon nowI could have bought this laptop from a local authorized seller but they are closeI won\'t suggest any of my friends buy from Amazon and Lenovo products if this is the service and quality of products
Heres the thing, I\'m gonna be honest this is a great laptop but.......I got the laptop and everything seems fine and worked great, I did numerous tests and all passed except the dead pixel test."
6004,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Most reviews here are positive and for good reason the laptop is amazing but defective products are there and you might be the unlucky one, refund is always an option tho so go for it if you wanna test your luck at getting a good non defective piece.Edit: On the second day I found out that the \'ctrl\' key is also defective, I might get a refund.Also the seller I bought from is Appario, it was priced at 67990.Edit 2: Well I refunded it, as a customer you have the right to receive a near perfect device for the money you pay dont accept a defective product however small just cause your excited.Stay safe peeps.Edit 3: I uploaded the pic of the dead pixel, its so small and barely noticeable but still annoying to the fact I know its there even tho I cant see it.Edit 4: The 67990 price version is completely sold out as of this moment."
6005,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"I watched movies in 2k hd are very good to see üôàConclusion:- Best laptop for this price 67k .It's good for gaming ,video editing and multitasking üßê."
6006,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Awesome product at this price rangeGood qualityPackaging was goodBUT.....my piece had a faulty speakerIt makes worst ever sound possibleI am not able to hear a thing from the speakerIts just disturbanceLuckily and fortunately they had me replacementBut it would take upto a month ...so sad
Laptop is awesome, I have tested few games for 3-4 hours, laptop didn't heat that much, was constantly howering between 70-75 degrees,I had order nitro 5 5600H laptop also, but had to return it due to one speaker not working at all just after 3 days( poor quality management from acer), got my refund and had decided to go with legion due to its premuim build and applause YouTube reviewers has given, and it didn't disappointed me even a single bit, speakers are loud, even 60% volume on this machine is louder than 100% volume of acer nitro 5Though acer nitro has good specs, their quality management needs to tighten things up, on the other hand Lenovo has impressed me to the next level, so if anyone is in doubt between Legion 5 4600H and Nitro 5 4600H or even Nitro 5 5600H, then trust me guys go with Legion 5 with eyes closed, this suggestion is coming from person who has used nitro 5 and legion 5 for almost 5 days each, go with legion 5 and you will not regret the decision, special thanks to Amazon and Appario for delivering this product quickly and in best condition."
6007,B08JLR7LPQ,price,It covers 45% NTSC color and almost every laptop(gaming) under this price range has the same so no worries.
6008,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"There's one thing that is subject to personal preference the backlight is basic not RGB, it would have been great if it had the RGB backlight keyboard BUT this normal white backlight also gives this laptop an elegant and bit more professional look.Graphics Card: it's the basic 1650 which is in every laptop coming in this price range and if you're a moderate gamer/casual gamer you should be okay with it."
6009,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"I've been playing Farcry 3 and 4 and it runs like makkhan in high & ultra settings.I bought it for 68k and now it's priced at more than 72k.It's competitors: Asus TUF f15 (Lol it's not a competitor), Acer Nitro 5 (somehow similar), HP victus 16 (do not even consider this).Verdict: Should you buy this?"
6010,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Literally, at this price its a supercar."
6011,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.
6012,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Great product for ~70k price point.
6013,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Amazon replaced it and the laptop is fantastic for the price.Performance is one of the best that you could get out of a 1650 and R5 4600H because of the thermals and ability to disable optimus.Battery is nothing to write a song about.
6014,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Overall a must buy laptop but with few years the GPU won't handle much of stuff., can't complain cuz we are in India where we are buying a 1000 dollar laptop for gtx 1650 where for the same price overseas we would get a 1660ti."
6015,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Packing was bad with tape worn out so I suspected foul play but it turned out to be packaging issue.On a side note: Kudos to Lenovo sales team for selling a 2020 laptop in '21 with higher prices than that of overseas.
6016,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Has dual channel ram which can be upgraded to 32 gb but 16gb is enough for gaming.Overall a Brilliant laptop in price segment.
6017,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"(Also instead of the usual selling price of 68k, the seller sold me this for 75k and I being in need of a good laptop bought this with no second thoughts."
6018,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Pls don't buy this if the price goes more than 72k.)
6019,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup."
6020,B08JLR7LPQ,price,I don't have much idea about technicalities but i know good graphics when i see them.At this price point it is absolutely worth it as it is a great gaming laptop as well as professional laptop.I like the look in particular because it doesn't look like other gaming laptops which look straight out of a teenager's aggressive wet dream.
6021,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Nice product at this price range built in qulity is good.
6022,B08JLR7LPQ,price,So nice deal at this price.
6023,B08JLR7LPQ,price,The ssd hdd hybrid combo is a perfect package of speed and size...im running all modern AAA titles smoothly and video editing is a breeze...takes only about 7 seconds or so to boot and whats noting is that since the display is directly connected to the graphics card this laptop is able to provide superior graphical perfomance than even its higher priced 1650ti and most 1660 counterpartsThe display is a treat to the eyes and i cant get ovee how great the laptop looks...the brightness is just perfect and ive had absolutely no issues with anything yet.
6024,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Everything is basically gliding in it
Received in excellent packagingAs far as purchase is concerned not a single time I have regretted this purchase for this price, laptop looks much better in reality than compare to image shown here,it does not look like gaming machine(this was my primary reason to buy it) it's fast, no lags,Amd ryzen 5 does handle all task with so much ease, it boots up in less than 5 seconds, does not heat up even after prolong use,keyboard is excellentOnly area where it could have been better was 1)battery expect around 2.5 to 3hours of backup battery2)camera it could have been better
It is a very very good and great laptop that I have bought from Amazon."
6025,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Worthy to buy ‚ù§Ô∏è
This beast is best at this price range."
6026,B08JLR7LPQ,price,Display is also good according to the price.In my opinion it is better the current gen ryzen laptop at this price range because they have some thermal issue or service availability is not good.
6027,B08JLR7LPQ,price,"Got it for 63.5K on deal of the day , and it's worthy of the price."

Doesn't meet the expectations better to go for dell g series and Intel processor and is becoming sluggish.. better to go i7 or atleast i5
Gaming could be done at high settings with minor glitchoverall a good project as compared to other i5 machines.THE ONLY ISSUE IS BATTERY LIFEI KID YOU NOT BRUV!This has pathetic backup."

I got my laptop in May and it had auto restart issue from starting and since then I am contacting Lenovo customer care but they don't even know how to fix it and keep saying we are working on the issue."
6061,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,But the battery charges fast enough as it is.Build quality: Legion is legion.
6062,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Hate  the quality control compared to the premium price the laptop cuts from our pocketsThis is so annoying in the pandemic it really difficult if these types of things occurGuys, there is a serious issue with Quality Control from Lenovo I guess they are selling their defective product now as there aren\'t many stocks of this laptopDon\'t get me wrong the laptop is top-notch but these quality control issues make it worstI want a new replacement from Amazon nowI could have bought this laptop from a local authorized seller but they are closeI won\'t suggest any of my friends buy from Amazon and Lenovo products if this is the service and quality of products
Heres the thing, I\'m gonna be honest this is a great laptop but.......I got the laptop and everything seems fine and worked great, I did numerous tests and all passed except the dead pixel test."

6064,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Awesome product at this price rangeGood qualityPackaging was goodBUT.....my piece had a faulty speakerIt makes worst ever sound possibleI am not able to hear a thing from the speakerIts just disturbanceLuckily and fortunately they had me replacementBut it would take upto a month ...so sad
Laptop is awesome, I have tested few games for 3-4 hours, laptop didn't heat that much, was constantly howering between 70-75 degrees,I had order nitro 5 5600H laptop also, but had to return it due to one speaker not working at all just after 3 days( poor quality management from acer), got my refund and had decided to go with legion due to its premuim build and applause YouTube reviewers has given, and it didn't disappointed me even a single bit, speakers are loud, even 60% volume on this machine is louder than 100% volume of acer nitro 5Though acer nitro has good specs, their quality management needs to tighten things up, on the other hand Lenovo has impressed me to the next level, so if anyone is in doubt between Legion 5 4600H and Nitro 5 4600H or even Nitro 5 5600H, then trust me guys go with Legion 5 with eyes closed, this suggestion is coming from person who has used nitro 5 and legion 5 for almost 5 days each, go with legion 5 and you will not regret the decision, special thanks to Amazon and Appario for delivering this product quickly and in best condition."
6065,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Hey,so I've been using this laptop for quite a bit as of now and here are few things that I like and dislike about this laptop in no particular order.Pros:First of all this laptop is blazing fast,like bootup,app loading etc takes minimal time and SSD is amazing.Build- completely made with plastic but it's super sturdy and great quality plastic is used,it will not feel cheap."
6066,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Unless you're pro photographer and color grading is your go to thing then I don't think you're looking for this laptop or you can get an additional monitor.Speakers- speakers in this laptop is good,you can watch movies without using earphones and worrying about sound quality,audio is by Harman Kardon and it offers great quality while consuming content.Keyboard- there are little things that we don't consider when we're buying a laptop, keyboard is one of them."
6067,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Its buttery smooth for each and every task you perform.The build quality, it was damn good and also the heat control of this lappy is insane."
6068,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"BUILD QUALITY =>  It has one of the finest build  quality around this budget, it goes head on with  the Asus Tuf lineup in terms of build quality.2."
6069,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,Will update if any response.4) Camera quality is bad.
6070,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,build quality is top notch.
6071,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,It barely runs for 2 hrs on balanced usage.Also the built quality is not great in this range and these are the areas where i think this product lags.My reviews are based on 3 months of usage.
6072,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"I am writing for 2 days usages .Battery - 85%Standing 4 to 5 hrs without gaming.Speed - 90%Login and logout , page surfing all are goodDisplay - 100%Smooth looking and good to viewCamera - 75%Good in meet callsSound - 85%Slight noise is there but good oneHardware - 100%Matt finish , quality keys , smooth ports and keybord light nice lookingOS - 100%Original OS but MS Office is trail only not original that's disappointed lotOverall - 90%Go for it ."
6073,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,When gaming or intensive work you should on conservative mode it will cut the power for laptop battery thus improving the life of battery.OTHERS - speakers aren't generally highlight of gaming laptops but it has still a good pair with nice quality and little bit of bass.
6074,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"According to me it is 100% worth to buy this laptop in the budget of under 70K.Let us now discuss about it's pros&cons:Pros:1.In fps games like VALORANT,CSGO,etc.It has given me 150+fps in Valorant and arnd 80-90 fps sometimes 100+ on Gta5 High and1080P.2.Second,comes it's thermals,which are very very much optimised,you got 4 air vents for cooling.3.Third is it's display which is connected direct to the Nvidia gpu and its Igpu is disabled.4.Minimum fan noise,your cieling fan can make more noise than this Laptop's fan.5.It's sound quality is above average,it comes with 2 speakers of 2-2 Watts each powered by Harman.Con's:There are not very much cons in this laptop but what I found is that:1.There should be a rgb keyboard at this price range in the Laptop but Lenovo doesn't provide us in this.It's battery backup is also not that bad,it's OK 3/5 for the Battery backup."
6075,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,Display and sound quality is super awesome.
6076,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Games like CS GO, cricket 19 and F1 2020 run like breeze , you can code quite easily on this , handles all processes with ease, display is great , speakers are great, build quality is phenomenal and simple."
6077,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"It will still survive :)
It's the best nd beast at this price point"", ""Writing this review after 1 month it totally met the expectation the ryzen 5 4600h is a beast in the mid range performance wise far better than intel i5 10th nd 11th gen cpuBattery life-great for normal day to day usageRecommended to plug in charger while gaming..comes with 170W fast chargerComes with Lenovo vantage software with lot of extra features to customise & for optimisationDisplay- ips fhd with 120hz refresh rate is good considering the price pointBuilt quality is the best one in comparison to any other laptops of other brands at same price point...feels very sturdy no flex at allBelieve me you won't get such built nd design from any other brands even at higher price rangeYou can upgrade ram(32gb max) as well as the ssdThermals are great...doesn't heat up much even while gaming must say lenovo did a great job on thermalsAll required ports are availableIts best one to go with at this price point

6085,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,I love the laptop build quality...It is really good among this segment..The battery life is average but it can be increased upto 6 to 8 hr if you put the laptop on silent mode as well as hybrid mode which restrict the dedicated gpu usage..so you can disable it just by enable hybrid mode in lenovo vintage app..The keyboard is really good.
6086,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,Only 2 things that could hv been better are- battery life for normal usage is not enough(2-3 hrs) and camera quality could hv been better like its competitors in same price range.
6087,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,Camera quality and battery is on the downside but it is manageable.My only concern is that the intake vents are comparatively big which supports thermals but also intake dust.
6088,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Screen goes maximum only 250 nits which is below average and there is screen bleeding which makes laptop hard to use in dark environment.Overall laptop and build quality is good but it is heavier than expected.The best thing is that thermal, no matter how much game you play it is never noticable
A perfect laptop for productivity and casual gaming don't think too much thermals are super fan noise is low

6107,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"I'm using it for a week,Pros-1.Ryzen 5 4600H with GTX1650 gives a good perfomance2.battery backup is good3.has 4 USB ports of 3rd generation4.no overheating issuesCons-1.keyboard could be RGB  Overall experience- best pick if your budget is 68k
for gaming go blind...it gives me an average of 150+ FPS every time in VALORENT.bulid quality is very good.cooling system is very effective.best value in 65k (sale)it comes with nice professional looks.it has the MUX switch which is quite impressive in this bujet.... very satisfied with this Lenovo product."
6108,B08JLR7LPQ,quality,"Excellent product, good quality, within 10 seconds fast booting due to ssd hardisk, performance is good , excellent design , packing was good and safe , received the product soon, fast delivery took only 3 days to deliver to Coimbatore, Tamilnadu."
6109,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,The laptop feels premium and the performance is smooth.
6110,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,Getting steady 75 fps in performance mode.
6111,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,You cant even hear its fans churning in the summer when your ceiling fan makes more noise than your laptop cracking games at performance mode üòùBattery: Reviews here are so negetive about battery but I found it to last around 6-7 hours when doing casual work.
6112,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,"Well still, Id say battery performance is sufficient."
6113,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,"üòÅCoding and video editing: If Multicore performance is what youre after, buy this laptop eyes closed."
6114,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,This is a beast in multicore performance.
6115,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,"You can tweak few settings in Lenovo's Vantage software.Performance: It's a beast,you can throw any apps and games in this can run that smoothly and R5 4600H is an amazing processor and combined with 1650 it delivers a great performance."
6116,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,"Everything was perfect, from packaging to performance."
6117,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,You can do every necessary thing for your laptop's good performance via that app.
6118,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,You cant change the 120Hz setting to 60Hz though.About the gaming performance: it actually is very scilent and thermally perfected.
6119,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,Everything is perfect!Well i was hoping for a good battery backup butit‚Äôs same as other laptops in this price range in terms of battery performanceBut you can get better batter backup using hybrid mode so it‚Äôs fine.One thing i can surely tell you that under 70k budget it‚Äôs the best laptop u can get now.Thermals are awesome and fans are not loud even in performance mode.120hz screen feels really smoothI bet you won‚Äôt switch to 60hz after using it.Overall it‚Äôs a good laptop and if you want to buy it you can go for it without any second thoughts but remember you won‚Äôt get battery backup for 8 hrs while playing games...2hrs-3hrs max u can get if it‚Äôs charged 100 percent but after turning on hybrid mode + lowering your brightness to 50-60 percent you can get battery backup upto 4-5 hrs.
6120,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,"can't say abt 5600h nitros
Overall performance is great in this range."
6121,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,Writing this review after 10 continuous days of usage.If you can get this laptop below 65k with offers and sale it is still the best option on market if you are a casual gamer or one interested in esports titles rather than AAA games.Processor - Ryzen 4600h is a beast in performance.
6122,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,I suggest you to upgrade it to 16 Gig by adding another 8 Gb stick as it will improve both your gaming and editing performance due to dual channel.DISPLAY - display is 120hz ips fhd panel with 280 nits brightness.
6123,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,The performance and gaming has no lag so far.
6124,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,"\xa0Firstofall go blindly with this laptopOne of the best laptop i have ever usedLook of laptop is just amazingEverything is buttery smoothRyzen 5 4000 series is a beast processorHands down better performance than asus tuf and nitro 5

6144,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,I love the look of the laptops and have heard good reviews from my friends regarding the performance.
6145,B08JLR7LPQ,performance,The dark look gets a lot of attention.The new AMD CPUs with the 1650 graphics deliver great performance.There is not much heating and the ports are all at the back so there are no wires around you while playing the game.Battery life is decent and gives about 3-4 hours of life.The keyboard layout is fantastic with minimum travel.Rating - 5/5 for this amazing laptop.

6149,B088CDKJ7V,quality,Honest Review After Using 1 Month+Pros:1-Best looking2-Booting and opening speed very very fast due to SSD3-Full hd 1080 display4-Perfomance is very goodCons1-Sound quality is disaster its a main issue you have to definitely buy a Bluetooth speaker for that.2-Battery life is average 3.5-4hrs if you will use continuously.3-No IPS is there in display thats why sides views are not so great and you can't complain about it under this price range.4-camera quality is not so good just below average.Conclusion:This is a value for money laptop and far far away than others in performance and features.
6150,B088CDKJ7V,quality,"But I bought this due to the brand and better build quality than avita.covid is to blame for this price hike.10 days after buying this, asus vivobook with same spec with backlit keyboard and fingerprint senser in flipkart was priced at 37500/- in a sale."
6151,B088CDKJ7V,quality,"!This is just after a week, more to come, Firstly the configuration for the price is amazing, value for money.Pros:Performance of AMD Ryzen 5 is amazing, being a its PCIe NVME board added advantageProcessor socket according to Reviews can be changed in future512gb SSD although you get 470gb is more than sufficent for medium usage,Ram is 8 GBBuild is solidSuper fast boot up and shut down times 8-10 sec averageSeems highly reliable, need to check in long runcons:Speaker Audio quality is lownothing elseOverall a 4 start just because of audio quality, very happy with the purchase, would highly recommend."

Pros:Fast performance due to ryzen5 processor and nvme SSD.No lags,good for multitasking in this price range.Pro tip: Though speaker quality is low but u can enhance audio quality by installing fx audio enhancer software.It works 100 percent to boost sound quality.Cons: bit heavier

6160,B088CDKJ7V,quality,"Getting straight to the point this laptop is decent, not that good and definitely not justifiable for the 42k price tag.Camera: Worse, like a 240p camera, they didn't even mention the quality/resolution in product description.Gaming: Absolutely not."

6180,B088CDKJ7V,quality,"I've been using this product for 11 months now and there are some pros and cons about this product.Pros: latest design, minimalist looks, thin bezels (not bezel less), good picture quality, AMD processor is boom, Enough  RAM to make it future proof.Cons: Speakers are trash (get a Bluetooth speaker for this one), Battery life is shit (I had to charge it 3-4 times during my 8hr shift of google meet and that too on battery saver and lowest brightness settings).Overall: The RAM, processor and SSD makes it a fast processing machine but at this price point, one can get way better options and if you're not about looks then buying a 2nd hand laptop would be a miles better deal, you can even get a more powerful processing unit if you search thoroughly and wisely in 2nd hand market."

6280,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,If you want photo editing and video editing you need to install an external screen ( it has usb-c video port)Battery: 9/10 I get it why people has so much complaint about battery backup.
6281,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,Yes it gives 1.5 hours of backup but you can increase it to 5+ hours (last night I did heavy coding and browsing for 4.5 hours with 30% battery left).
6282,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,The trick is toi) enable hybrid mode.ii) while in battery backup press fn+q to make it in silent mode so that the fan speed reduces and uses less power.iii) reduce screen brightness by 2 pointsiv) switch off bluetooth if not usingThis should be enough to give 5 hours of backup easily.Asthetic: (5/10) the only thing I hate more than the screne is the body work of laptop.
6283,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,It does catch the hand marks but you can clear them off easily5) I saw several reviews complaining of the battery but if you turn on the balanced mode(which is sufficient for my office work) then it easily gives 4-5 hours of backup.

6285,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,"But with some online help from Lenovo support team and some surfing on net, now it's giving battery life of 4-6 hours."

Overall performance of the laptop is really good but the only disadvantage is the battery life."
6290,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,The battery life is around 2 to 2 1/2 hrs.
6291,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,Since it has a 120hz display the battery drains quickly.
6292,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,Everything is perfect except the battery back up.
6293,B09DMYZW5Q,battery,Doesn't last for more than 80-90 mins on battery.

6301,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,Yes it gives 1.5 hours of backup but you can increase it to 5+ hours (last night I did heavy coding and browsing for 4.5 hours with 30% battery left).

6303,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,It does catch the hand marks but you can clear them off easily5) I saw several reviews complaining of the battery but if you turn on the balanced mode(which is sufficient for my office work) then it easily gives 4-5 hours of backup.
6304,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,If the balanced mode is not turned on it gives 2 hours max.Cons:1) display is okaish.
6305,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,Initially I had battery issue where battery was draining in 2 hours.
6306,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,"But with some online help from Lenovo support team and some surfing on net, now it's giving battery life of 4-6 hours."
6307,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,Even after 3 hours of gaming there isn't any heat issues....
6308,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,There is no lag at all while you are playing the NFS Run GTA V. But the battery life disappointed me as It will stay awake for some 2 hours even though the laptop is idle.
6309,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,""", ""I used to think a desktop was the only possible option for a good gaming experience because I've seen my friends with different gaming laptops with heating issues and frequent frame drops.But this laptop can run games for hours and hours and never give you a bad experience."
6310,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,Just plug in the charger and you can play for hours.
6311,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,And Battery backup is only 3 hours rather than 8 hours mentioned in the sales reviews.
6312,B09DMYZW5Q,hours,Backup in a system is just 1.5-2 hours.
6313,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,I play couple of AAA games and it's running smooth with 80-90 fps easily.Screen : 6/10 the screen leaves a lot to be desired.
6314,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,It's a 200 hz screen so better for gaming but the sRGB and color profiles are not atall upto mark.
6315,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,"Wish they provided the 60hz 300 nits 100% rgb screen through amazon as well (it's available in lenovo official website, just paying 1700 rupees more you can update the screen but the overall custom laptop costs 1.2 lakhs with same config)."
6316,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,If you want photo editing and video editing you need to install an external screen ( it has usb-c video port)Battery: 9/10 I get it why people has so much complaint about battery backup.

6318,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,200 nits i guess.Defective screen.
6319,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,Very pleasant experience when you look at this laptop's screen.
6320,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,"apart from these two, this wast the best among All other Laptops, damn Sure...
Only negative point is the brightness of the screen."
6321,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,"It will fully charge when u plug in below 90percent
study , phd but it spoiled my full study program and screen was going off erratic and after lot of effort the screen was repaird and again it started the same problem.Big headache,customer service also very poor in fact it is customer harassment."
6322,B09DMYZW5Q,screen,Backlit is only white and the brightness of the screen is a bit low .
6323,B09DMYZW5Q,gaming,It's a 200 hz screen so better for gaming but the sRGB and color profiles are not atall upto mark.
6324,B09DMYZW5Q,gaming,Now I am looking for laptop skins to put on and using external keyboard for gaming and coding.Overall it is a solid performer with few flaws.

It was delivered the next dayGraphics processor is good and delivers crisp imagesLiked the Legion and is working good for us
Overall performance is very good and it has a great design but battery backup is max 4-4.5 hrs."
6340,B09DMYZW5Q,backup,And Battery backup is only 3 hours rather than 8 hours mentioned in the sales reviews.
6341,B095SBXKLW,keyboard,The keyboard area heats up very high just in minutes.
6342,B095SBXKLW,keyboard,"Also, your hands will feel the heat from the keyboard very very noticeably if you even slightly stress the CPU with heavy-duty software, if you are using it for gaming or content creation, you will have to disable turbo tech from the BIOS, else I fear that this kind of heat will affect other components."
6343,B095SBXKLW,keyboard,"The lid does catch hand grease and dust, while the deck and keyboard are quite the opposite, and the same goes for cleaning either."
6344,B095SBXKLW,keyboard,"The bezels could be thinner, and a privacy shutter on the webcam would've been much appreciated.The keyboard comes with royal blue color backlight with 2 stages of intensity, controlled by the F10 key."

The screen quality is nice and the battery life is sufficient for day to day tasks like making a presentation or checking and responding to e-mails."
6355,B095SBXKLW,battery,"I haven't tested battery life for gaming, but I wouldn't recommend it."
6356,B095SBXKLW,gaming,"Also, your hands will feel the heat from the keyboard very very noticeably if you even slightly stress the CPU with heavy-duty software, if you are using it for gaming or content creation, you will have to disable turbo tech from the BIOS, else I fear that this kind of heat will affect other components."

6358,B095SBXKLW,gaming,"I haven't tested battery life for gaming, but I wouldn't recommend it."

6456,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"Anyway I got cheaper one (which got delivered from Bengaluru) post cancelling non-backlit one (which was initiated from Mumbai)I haven‚Äôt tested its full battery and performance with games, coding yet."
6457,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"Screen is great, typing experience is wonderful, speakers are good too and the battery life is about 5.5 hours based upon normally web browsing, lot of typing and occasionally watching movies as well."
6458,B09GB2N7M7,battery,The finger print scanner works fine as well.I have only two complains about this product that is first is the battery backup in descrition it says upto 12 hrs but it only stays alive upto 4-5 hours please look into this and second is that you can't install graphics card and the video memory is of only 1gb VRAM so you can't edit vidoes smoothly or play some little bit 3D games 2D ames works fine.CONCLUSION:if you can sacrifice games then go for this laptop if you cna't then look for gaming laptop as in this price segment you can get some great gaming laptops and yeah you can't return and have refund for this product.
6459,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"After update I faced yellow tint display issue, but I fix this issue from Lenovo Vantage app.You can do setting in Lenovo Vantage app to improve battery cycle life.Silent laptop there is no noise issue and heating issue.Made in India printed backside on laptop and Made in China printed on Charger.Finger Sensor is good in built in power button.Sound quality is clear but not loud.MS Office Home & Student gives you Word, Excel, PowerPoint, One note."
6460,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"But no complaints here because dull screen was mentioned in so many reviews.Battery is good and battery management is very good.Overall design and keybord is excellent.After watching so many reviews,  I realized that Thinkpad is actually a very premium brand and its E series is cheaper one.Some tips for accessories: sleeve for E14 should be purchased of 13.3 size if it is Targus one."
6461,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"But, though battery claim is it will last for 12-13 hours, it does not."
6462,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"I bought it for 58k.I think it is a value for money if you want good built quality, good battery backup, fingerprint senser, and many features which prove that this suffices the needs of almost everyone.Even though it has i5, it still gets done most of the jobs without an issue, but you will definitely feel the difference with i7, like I did since had been using a lenovo i7 thinkpad before this."
6463,B09GB2N7M7,battery,"* Good battery life, lasts a day,with full recharge and 8-10 hours usage."

6483,B09GB2N7M7,battery,Then after 1 year there were battery issues and call reception issues.
6484,B09GB2N7M7,battery,My battery is not working anymore.
6485,B09GB2N7M7,office,I have 15.6 inch office laptop and at times with single hand it feels large.3.
6486,B09GB2N7M7,office,MS Office- it has MS office home and student edition which gets activated once linked to Microsoft account (Key detail is on Box as well).
6487,B09GB2N7M7,office,Display- Not as good as MacBook but better than my office HP laptop.
6488,B09GB2N7M7,office,"I have done it multiple times at office while cable is pulled accidentally or water droplets are spilled while using sipper It can rotate 180 degree but it doesn‚Äôt have all angle view optimised, so its better to use at normal laptop angle .6 Cooling- it didn‚Äôt get hot."
6489,B09GB2N7M7,office,"But as it‚Äôs mostly for home and  limited office use, it is descent for that3."
6490,B09GB2N7M7,office,"N that too may be due to this single memory slot available with the laptop- office that has been offered as MS Office 2019, is not the complete one."
6491,B09GB2N7M7,office,This laptop is best for sort a person who is looking for serious office work and doesn‚Äôt want to spend money on a laptop for at least 5-7 years.
6492,B09GB2N7M7,office,It‚Äôs the whole nine yards!6) Noise: The laptop is extremely quiet.The Bad:1) Windows and Office: With a business laptop they should bundle a Win10 Pro and full feature office but all in all can‚Äôt complain.2) Speakers: I mean they are nice but nothing to write home about.
6493,B09GB2N7M7,office,Free windows 10 and office 20193.
6494,B09GB2N7M7,office,"(For me its fine as I play games on mobile, and use video/photo editing once in a blue moon )After usage:- Boots up in less than 10 seconds or even faster- I did not hear fan sound, as I have not used CPU intensive apps.- Battery is definitely good, when compared to my office laptop- Sound by Harman, feels good."
6495,B09GB2N7M7,office,"I see this as bonus.I had initial difficulty setting up office license, as the pre-installed once is office-360, after reaching Microsoft support they have fixed this for me by installing other version of office."
6496,B09GB2N7M7,office,Durable and easy to use.Only difficulty I faced was that the Ms office which is pre-installed was not working for me and it took a lot of hassle to call up customer care and ultimately it was resolved by Microsoft customer care.
6497,B09GB2N7M7,office,They uninstalled and installed the right Ms office for me.
6498,B09GB2N7M7,office,Trust me I have used it in my office too.
6499,B09GB2N7M7,office,I was searching for a laptop that I can use for my office & personal use.
6500,B09GB2N7M7,office,"I am working in an IT firm & used many of business laptops.But thinkpad impressed me the most for it's durability & quality.I was searching a good laptop for office uses andafter reviewd a lot i choose thinkpad E14 over dell inspiron .Below are some highlights i experienced over a week.Pros-Good displayNice keyboardBest processerFast chargingCons-Sound quality is not that great.No bags provided with box
I love it!"
6501,B09GB2N7M7,office,Ppt and others dont open instantly keep prompting to install MS office and Office 360.
6502,B09GB2N7M7,office,"Finally it is installed but still has issue with Word, Ppt and Excel and keeps asking to install MS office
The laptop is great, for academic purpose though."
6503,B09GB2N7M7,office,"Only sour point is , MS office cannot be enabled even though the account was there
Best configuration in this price."
6504,B09GB2N7M7,office,Unable to activate office 365.
6505,B09GB2N7M7,office,Product key for office is not present.
6506,B09GB2N7M7,office,"Good product

6508,B09GB2N7M7,office,When I tried to activate microsoft office home in my system it is asking buy options .
6509,B09GB2N7M7,office,Installation of ms office was hassle free.
6510,B09GB2N7M7,office,As it comes with windows and student office.
6511,B09GB2N7M7,office,With this product give ms office 2019 without product key.

6514,B09GB2N7M7,display,There was no screen  display  just some light in power button and escape key.
6515,B09GB2N7M7,display,Now I don't know what's gonna happen next.Edit: Got the replacement in 4 days .Review after 3 days of usage.Cons: Avg display .
6516,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Core i5 10th Gen fast processor variant and not the other variants of the 10th Gen i5 those are good but this one is the best, with 128 GB SSD (hopefully PCle NVMe M.2- need to check this) plus 1 TB HHD with FHD display n viewing angles are better n more than the other laptops in this price range where the screen is anti glare as well- Colors are accurate n I believe it's all how the RGB range is set for this FHD screen."
6517,B09GB2N7M7,display,I would say best in class display- ThinkPad itself is a well reputed segment that is set to deliver the professional class performance n I believe it'll be able to meet that benchmark it has set for itself.
6518,B09GB2N7M7,display,"I hope Lenovo works on this n we see a more truthful products in the future to come
After using for 4 days...facing display issueThe seller is selling defective laptops with discount.I have raised request to return the product, I will keep posted on the further statusI kindly request not to purchase this product
Display is really average, returned one unit because of faulty trackpadGot second replacement, this one had yellow ugly tint on display ..Already an average display with yellowish tint made the experience bad."
6519,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Have requested for refund now.Whule buying it's about luck as to whether you get normal whites or yellowish tint display
Really nice product...Go for it.. üëçüèª
I already had an other thinkpad laptop for the last 7 years."
6520,B09GB2N7M7,display,At 60K price it still lacks poor display for movies and games.
6521,B09GB2N7M7,display,"I didn't had that need but other laptops in this price offers better display
Apart from the display, everything else is fine."
6522,B09GB2N7M7,display,the display has a flickering.
6523,B09GB2N7M7,display,thinking of replacing.Looking at the other reviews I think the entire lot that the seller got has faulty displays.
6524,B09GB2N7M7,display,The display is fine as well if looked from side angle there's no contrast but when it looked from above or bottome we can see the colour being detoriated.
6525,B09GB2N7M7,display,"After update I faced yellow tint display issue, but I fix this issue from Lenovo Vantage app.You can do setting in Lenovo Vantage app to improve battery cycle life.Silent laptop there is no noise issue and heating issue.Made in India printed backside on laptop and Made in China printed on Charger.Finger Sensor is good in built in power button.Sound quality is clear but not loud.MS Office Home & Student gives you Word, Excel, PowerPoint, One note."
6526,B09GB2N7M7,display,"I have been using laptops since almost 16 years and have used multiple brands with a MacBook pro being the last one.Everything is good but the viewing angles of the display are aweful, same model with lesser money has an IPS panel in the USA/Canada."
6527,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Has all the essentials, is lightweight, sturdy, no creaking panels.Backlit keyboard is a nice touch.Decent speakers.No heating issues.No lag experienced so far.Only con is that display is nor very bright neither of great quality.Go for it if you are an MBA Student or a business professional as its very easy to carry around and can handle drops and knocks exceptionally well."
6528,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Not heavy but not light definitely.Camera- Nothing great or amazing, but should be fine for video calls and all.Display- I like the display, nothing wrong with it.Battery- Good 7-8 hour backup."

Poor quality display and got defective flickering screen."
6533,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Audio is good which includes Dolby Atmos.Cons: average camera quality, finger marks will be printed on the laptop (as it is black it is not much visible)Pros: USB 3.1(Gen 1), USB 3.1 ports are given which speeds up reading the data, pre installed microsoft home, good display, etc.I think it is the best laptop in the given price range."

6535,B09GB2N7M7,display,I don't know why people are complaining about the display.
6536,B09GB2N7M7,display,The display is just fine.
6537,B09GB2N7M7,display,Machine offers excellent specifications and performance but comes with below average display and Webcam Quality which brings the overall experience down.
6538,B09GB2N7M7,display,Performance wise laptop is good buy display is worst.
6539,B09GB2N7M7,display,If you are looking for laptop with great display then it's not a good choice.For me display is important therefore not worth 60k.
6540,B09GB2N7M7,display,The display of my laptop is very poor.
6541,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Audio and speed and fhd display is better
Good
Keyboard is not working after 10 months of use."
6542,B09GB2N7M7,display,The display is worst in this price range.
6543,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Brought this product in August, its really a great product but one thing was totally unacceptable which is display."
6544,B09GB2N7M7,display,It has got TN display which has poor viewing angles and poor color reproduction other wise excellent product and it also has WIFI 6.
6545,B09GB2N7M7,display,"Damaged
very slow and display not working properly."
6546,B09GB2N7M7,screen,14inch- I prefer 14inch screen as it‚Äôs appropriate unless u play games.
6547,B09GB2N7M7,screen,Next I poweron the laptop and saw screen was flickering and suddenly  laptop went DEAD.!!!
6548,B09GB2N7M7,screen,There was no screen  display  just some light in power button and escape key.
6549,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"Core i5 10th Gen fast processor variant and not the other variants of the 10th Gen i5 those are good but this one is the best, with 128 GB SSD (hopefully PCle NVMe M.2- need to check this) plus 1 TB HHD with FHD display n viewing angles are better n more than the other laptops in this price range where the screen is anti glare as well- Colors are accurate n I believe it's all how the RGB range is set for this FHD screen."
6550,B09GB2N7M7,screen,Will weigh it on a scale n confirm backNow coming to its few negative traits:- it does not have a full metal body but thin metal just on the screen flap which looks like a metallic spray paint done on the plastics.
6551,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"But when i went through the reviews, some reviews were really bad mostly regarding screen."
6552,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"When I received the product, to my delight, the screen was good (no yellowish light issue) and then I went through every aspect of this product carefully."
6553,B09GB2N7M7,screen,It should also be mentioned that they are tuned by Herman.3) Screen: The screen is an anti-glare Led lit LCD.
6554,B09GB2N7M7,screen,This screen is above average.The Ugly:1) Camera: This camera is straight up bad....
6555,B09GB2N7M7,screen,Big and bulky (screen could have smaller Basel)2.
6556,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"now the entire screen is flickering (I was using it in the dark mode, so it was clearly visible)."
6557,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"@Amazon pls change the product, received defective product.NO HELP FROM LENEVO PLEASE HELP TO REPLACE AS NOONE SUPPORTING FROM LENEVO
The screen is defective."
6558,B09GB2N7M7,screen,there is yellow tint and the screen colour looks warm always.
6559,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"Its not like you boot up to a un-lock/login screen and then you have to place finger.- Obviously the keyboard and the BackLight.- Military grade body, I am sure its robust then its peers.- In-built webcam.- Type-C USB charging port & you can use it for connecting USB devices."
6560,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"I purchased this laptop because of its light weight and good ergonomically designed keyboard.Coming from Dell studio 15.6 inch laptop, screen is noticeably duller but viewing angles are good."
6561,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"But no complaints here because dull screen was mentioned in so many reviews.Battery is good and battery management is very good.Overall design and keybord is excellent.After watching so many reviews,  I realized that Thinkpad is actually a very premium brand and its E series is cheaper one.Some tips for accessories: sleeve for E14 should be purchased of 13.3 size if it is Targus one."
6562,B09GB2N7M7,screen,Screenguard application is difficult and makes screen more dull.I purchased it in 57240 in prime day sale.
6563,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"45 minutes and you‚Äôre good to go for 5 hours.Built quality is obviously great because of thinkpad brand.Touch sensor is fast, keyboard is awesome and screen is okayish.Light weight but not the lightest.It has a manual cover for camera, so good for those who require this feature.Sound is crisp, clear but not loud.Its look screams that it only means buisness.So overall a good balanced product for 60k."
6564,B09GB2N7M7,screen,I purchased this product in August and within 45 days dead pixels started appearing on the screen.
6565,B09GB2N7M7,screen,Screen colors get change if two people watching screen were not in single plane.3.
6566,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"Joints between the screen and outer plastics layer got disoriented which may lead to damage
We  purchased on 17-Oct-20."
6567,B09GB2N7M7,screen,I can c the screen flickering and screen would turnoff and on automatically for  o reason.I suggest not to buy this and feel disappointed lated.
6568,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"Cant you give good product inspite of charging such a huge amount
Poor quality display and got defective flickering screen."
6569,B09GB2N7M7,screen,Anti-glare Full HD screen is good for eyes as well.5.
6570,B09GB2N7M7,screen,"it's robust  , light weight , anti glare  , , , , , ,
